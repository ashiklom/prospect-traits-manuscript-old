# Introduction

## Outline

**Biodiversity, specifically plant functional diversity, is important**
Plant functional diversity is inextricably linked to ecosystem functioning [@reichstein_linking_2014].
Relationship of functional diversity to overall productivity is complex, with increased productivity with increasing biodiversity in many cases (**refs in Hooper**) but evidence suggesting such increases are limited to certain species combinations [@hooper_overyielding_2004; probably @hooper_effects_2005].


**Plant functional traits are a powerful framework for studying plant functional diversity** [@violle_let_2007].
Identification of coordinated relationships of plant functional traits with environmental conditions is appealing for ecological inference and modelling because it greatly facilitates the representation of functional response to environmental change [@van_bodegom_fully_2014; @]. (**DGVM trait papers here**)
Traits can also be used to model community composition:

* @jamil_selecting_2013 -- species means, GLMM 
* Shipley's MaxEnt model [@shipley_plant_2006; @laughlin_climatic_2011]
* Laughlin's hierarchical model [@laughlin_predictive_2012]
* Community-weighted means, custom "CATS" model [@frenette-dussault_trait-based_2013]
* PCA on traits to classify plants into Grime's CSR functional types [@pierce_allocating_2013]
* Multimodal version of the traitspace model [@laughlin_quantifying_2015]

Leaf traits in particular are consistently among the most important traits for predicting community composition [@laughlin_intrinsic_2014].
Plant functional traits modulate species responses to environmental gradients [@pollock_role_2012; **others**].
Understanding the structure and inherent dimensionality of the plant functional trait space is important to identifying the marginal information content of multiple trait observations, which is critical to maximizing the utility of costly trait collection efforts and for predicting species distributions [@laughlin_intrinsic_2014; @bernhardt-romermann_identification_2008; @shiklomanov_scaling_????; @weiher_challenging_1999; @perez-harguindeguy_new_2013].
Better understanding of the drivers of trait variability will also be useful for imputation of missing data in trait databases [@taugourdeau_filling_2014].
This imputation also provides an excellent mechanism for testing theories of functional variability, as the imputation is effectively a phylogenetic forecast.


**Lots to be gained from global studies of species and community-level means.**
Many important theories of species-level function related to traits, aided by the increased prevalence of global trait datasets [e.g. TRY, @kattge_try_2011; betydb, @lebauer_betydb:_2017].

Grime's CSR functional types.

Leaf and plant economic spectrum [@wright_worldwide_2004; @reich_world-wide_2014; @diaz_global_2016; @ordonez_global_2009]

@westoby_leaf-height-seed_1998 strategy has three axes, of which only one is related to the leaf economic spectrum [@laughlin_multi-trait_2010].
(**More examples**). 


**Need to capture sub-species-level variability**
Understanding variability at the sub-species level is critical to predictive ecology, as this is the scale at which most relevant ecophysiological processes occur.
Although the plant ecology tends to focus on interspecific variability, intraspecific variability is also important [@albert_intraspecific_2010; @albert_multi-trait_2010; @albert_when_2011].
To quote @clark_individual-scale_2011, "Species do not compete, individuals do. Species do not respond to climate, individuals respond to weather."
Community mean trait variability is driven both by composition and plasticity of individual species [@richardson_resorption_2005].
@clark_why_2016 argues that uncertainty in composition contributes more than uncertainty in traits to overall uncertainty in community-weighted means.

* @violle_return_2012 -- Return of the variance: intraspecific variability
* @messier_how_2010 -- Multi-scale inference
* @messier_trait_2016 -- Leaf economic spectrum at local scales

Different ecological processes occur at different scales.
For example, global studies of species- and community-level aggregates may capture broad-scale environmental filters, but trait variability at smaller scales becomes increasingly affected by limiting similarity [@clark_individual-scale_2011; @kraft_functional_2008; **refs therein; need a classic paper here**].


**Measuring enough traits for multi-scale inference is hard. Leaf spectral measurements are a promising solution.**
Understanding plant functional variability requires trait measurements at many different scales, and capturing acclimatory ecophysiological responses further requires repeat measurements of traits on the same individual and probably even the same organ.
These goals are difficult to achieve using traditional approaches to trait measurement because they are very labor intensive, limiting sample sizes required for robust inference, and are almost always destructive, precluding repeat sampling for tracking developmental and acclimatory responses.
By comparison, spectral measurements are considerably easier and faster to collect, and are non-destructive, allowing repeat sampling over the course of a season or experimental manipulation.
Hyperspectral reflectance measurements in particular also have more information content than direct trait measurements, with a single observation capable of providing information about multiple traits [@roth_leaf_2016].
This means that spectra are uniquely equipped to avoid disaggregation of trait information [@clark_individual-scale_2011].
Optical functional types (**Ustin & Gamon 2010**)
Spectral measurements have been successfully used to investigate:

* Leaf reflectance is related to plant stress [@carter_responses_1993; @penuelas_reflectance_1994; @penuelas_reflectance_1993]
* @serbin_leaf_2011 -- Sensitivity to temperature (PLSR)
* @serbin_spectroscopic_2014 -- Trait estimation (PLSR)
* @asner_amazonian_2014 -- Investigate the drivers of functional diversity (very similar to what I'm trying to do, only limited to the Amazon, and using PLSR)
* Refer to review by @penuelas_visible_1998
* @zajec_limestone_2016 show effects of limestone dust deposition on leaf optical properties and traits.

Moreover, spectral measurements also provide a link to remote sensing, which creates the potential for trait inference at the landscape and regional scale over long time scales [@asner_large-scale_2016].
Understanding spectral and functional variability at the plot scale is also important to determining the potential of using satellite remote sensing, which is fundamentally limited by spatial resolution to at least the plot scale and above, to study traits.
The vast increase in spatial scale and continuity afforded by remote measurement of plant traits will also be very helpful in overcoming current sampling biases in trait databases [e.g. @sandel_estimating_2015].


**Most spectra-trait methods are empirical. Our RTM approach is better. (Should this go in methods?)**
The typical approaches to estimating traits from spectra are based on empirical calibrations of spectra with direct measurements of leaf traits, through the use of
spectral indices [@sims_relationships_2002; @feret_optimizing_2011; @colombo_estimation_2008; @stimson_spectral_2005; @penuelas_reflectance_1993; @penuelas_reflectance_1994; @maki_estimation_2004; @datt_remote_1998; @danson_estimating_2004], 
wavelet transforms [@cheng_spectroscopic_2011; @cheng_deriving_2014; @blackburn_retrieval_2008; @rivard_continuous_2008; @bruce_wavelets_2001], 
clustering algorithms [e.g. random forest, @clark_species-level_2012], 
or partial least squares regression [@serbin_leaf_2011; @serbin_spectroscopic_2014; @asner_amazonian_2014; @asner_functional_2014; @chavana-bryant_leaf_2016].
In this study, however, we estimate traits from spectra using Bayesian inversion of the PROSPECT 5 model [@jacquemoud_prospect_1990; @feret_prospect-4_2008] described in @shiklomanov_quantifying_2016.
This approach has three important advantages.
First, because it is underpinned by a mechanistic model, it is likely to be more general than empirical approaches relying on site-specific calibrations.
An early critique of empirical approaches is @grossman_critique_1996, who showed that, for example, absorption coefficients selected by multiple regression are primarily a statistical artifact.
Second, the Bayesian aspect allows for the estimation of uncertainty in leaf traits due to errors in the observation or model.
Notably, Bayesian radiative transfer model inversion is compatible with data in a wide variety of formats, spectral resolutions, and transformations because the modeled spectra can always be transformed to match the observations [e.g., spectral resolution in @shiklomanov_quantifying_2016].
This flexibility is particularly important to studies like this one, where data are taken from multiple projects and instruments.
Third, the use of radiative transfer models is important to understanding the underlying physical mechanisms underlying variability in foliar optical properties.
In particular, complex multivariate regression analyses such as PLSR select wavelengths based entirely on model accuracy rather than physical meaning of the underlying coefficients (though diligent studies check that these variable selection techniques align with known absorption features; e.g. @serbin_spectroscopic_2014).


## Old Notes

However, plant economic relationships often do not hold at smaller scales.
For example, in an analysis of global foliar plant traits from the TRY database, Shiklomanov et al. [-@shiklomanov_scaling_????] (in review) found that trait variability is fundamentally hierarchical, with leaf economic relationships primarily observed between means of plant functional types while the same correlations within plant functional types were significantly weaker or even of opposite sign.
Many studies of plant traits at the scale of individual sites also found weak or no evidence of leaf economic relationships (**REF**).
The same is true of studies of trait variability across environmental gradients.
For instance, although globally, *TRAIT X DECLINES/INCREASES* with temperature, local-scale studies along elevation gradients observed the opposite (**REF**). 
Similarly, although enhanced nutrient availability should promote increased *TRAIT X*, greenhouse studies precisely controlling soil nutrient levels observed *TRAIT X INCREASES/DECLINES* with increased N availability (**REF**).

The same traits have been found to be primarily influenced by different environmental filters in different studies. 
For instance, many studies in grasslands [e.g. @kleyer_assessing_2012 **and refs therein**; @louault_plant_2005] found that C:N ratio and canopy height are strongly modulated by grazing intensity more than soil nutrient content (though they say the phosphorus thing is due to "site peculiarities", namely defecating animals), but **Westoby et al. (1996)** and **Grime et al. (1997)** (**What biomes??**) found the opposite, whereby leaf C:N ratio and height were more closely linked to soil nutrients than disturbance intensity.


In addition, leaf economic traits do not capture all aspects of plant function; for instance, they are decoupled from plant hydraulic traits [@li_leaf_2015; @sack_hydrology_2003].


This study is driven by the following research questions:

#. How accurate is Bayesian PROSPECT inversion for estimating leaf traits from spectra across a variety of ecosystems?
#. How are leaf optical traits related to other leaf foliar traits?
#. What are the biotic and abiotic drivers of variability in leaf optical traits?

*More questions / ideas*
    
* How well does PROSPECT inversion capture each level of variability?
    - Perform validations on aggregated averages by species, and maybe functional type, site, attributes, etc.
    - Possibly investigate not just absolute trait values, but residuals from above means
