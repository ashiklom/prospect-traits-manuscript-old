# Introduction

@zajec_limestone_2016 show effects of limestone dust deposition on leaf optical properties and traits.

@roth_leaf_2016 use PCA on spectra to show that leaves 

Research questions:
* Methodological:
    - How well can foliar traits be estimated from leaf spectra via PROSPECT inversion? 
* Ecological:
    - How do foliar traits covary with each other?
    - What are the dominant sources of variability in foliar traits?
    - How are traits related to plant functional attributes and climate?
