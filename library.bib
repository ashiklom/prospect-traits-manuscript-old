  abstract = {We examined variation in leaf size and specific leaf area (SLA) in relation to the distribution of 22 chaparral shrub species on small-scale gradients of aspect and elevation. Potential incident solar radiation (insolation) was estimated from a geographic information system to quantify microclimate affinities of these species across north- and south-facing slopes. At the community level, leaf size and SLA both declined with increasing insolation, based on average trait values for the species found in plots along the gradient. However, leaf size and SLA were not significantly correlated across species, suggesting that these two traits are decoupled and associated with different aspects of performance along this environmental gradient. For individual species, SLA was negatively correlated with species distributions along the insolation gradient, and was significantly lower in evergreen versus deciduous species. Leaf size exhibited a negative but non-significant trend in relation to insolation distribution of individual species. At the community level, variance in leaf size increased with increasing insolation. For individual species, there was a greater range of leaf size on south-facing slopes, while there was an absence of small-leaved species on north-facing slopes. These results demonstrate that analyses of plant functional traits along environmental gradients based on community level averages may obscure important aspects of trait variation and distribution among the constituent species.},

  abstract = {Hyperspectral remote sensing serves as an effective tool for estimating foliar nitrogen using a variety of techniques. Vegetation indices (VIs) are a simple means of retrieving foliar nitrogen. Despite their popularity, few studies have been conducted to examine the utility of VIs for mapping canopy foliar nitrogen in a mixed forest context. In this study, we assessed the performance of 32 vegetation indices derived from HySpex airborne hyperspectral images for estimating canopy mass-based foliar nitrogen concentration (\%N) in the Bavarian Forest National Park. The partial least squares regression (PLSR) was performed for comparison. These vegetation indices were classified into three categories that are mostly correlated to nitrogen, chlorophyll, and structural properties such as leaf area index (LAI). \%N was destructively measured in 26 broadleaf, needle leaf, and mixed stand plots to represent the different species and canopy structure. The canopy foliar \%N is defined as the plot-level mean foliar \%N of all species weighted by species canopy foliar mass fraction. Our results showed that the variance of canopy foliar \%N is mainly explained by functional type and species composition. The normalized difference nitrogen index (NDNI) produced the most accurate estimation of \%N (R2CV = 0.79, RMSECV = 0.26). A comparable estimation of \%N was obtained by the chlorophyll index Boochs2 (R2CV = 0.76, RMSECV = 0.27). In addition, the mean NIR reflectance (800\textendash{}850 nm), representing canopy structural properties, also achieved a good accuracy in \%N estimation (R2CV = 0.73, RMSECV = 0.30). The PLSR model provided a less accurate estimation of \%N (R2CV = 0.69, RMSECV = 0.32). We argue that the good performance of all three categories of vegetation indices in \%N estimation can be attributed to the synergy among plant traits (i.e., canopy structure, leaf chemical and optical properties) while these traits may converge across plant species for evolutionary reasons. Our findings demonstrated the feasibility of using hyperspectral vegetation indices to estimate \%N in a mixed temperate forest which may relate to the effect of the physical basis of nitrogen absorption features on canopy reflectance, or the biological links between nitrogen, chlorophyll, and canopy structure.},

  abstract = {Free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments provide a remarkable wealth of data which can be used to evaluate and improve terrestrial ecosystem models (TEMs). In the FACE model-data synthesis project, 11 TEMs were applied to two decadelong FACE experiments in temperate forests of the southeastern U.S.\textemdash{}the evergreen Duke Forest and the deciduous Oak Ridge Forest. In this baseline paper, we demonstrate our approach to model-data synthesis by evaluating the models' ability to reproduce observed net primary productivity (NPP), transpiration, and leaf area index (LAI) in ambient CO2 treatments. Model outputs were compared against observations using a range of goodness-of-fit statistics. Many models simulated annual NPP and transpiration within observed uncertainty. We demonstrate, however, that high goodness-of-fit values do not necessarily indicate a successful model, because simulation accuracy may be achieved through compensating biases in component variables. For example, transpiration accuracy was sometimes achieved with compensating biases in leaf area index and transpiration per unit leaf area. Our approach to model-data synthesis therefore goes beyond goodness-of-fit to investigate the success of alternative representations of component processes. Here we demonstrate this approach by comparing competing model hypotheses determining peak LAI. Of three alternative hypotheses\textemdash(1) optimization to maximize carbon export, (2) increasing specific leaf area with canopy depth, and (3) the pipe model\textemdash{}the pipe model produced peak LAI closest to the observations. This example illustrates how data sets from intensive field experiments such as FACE can be used to reduce model uncertainty despite compensating biases by evaluating individual model assumptions.},

The improvements are qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those obtained from simulations initialized with ground measurements and approximately double the estimated rate of ecosystem carbon uptake as compared to a potential vegetation simulation.

Repeat photography shows that there has been an increase in shrub cover over the past 50 years in northern Alaska. Using 202 pairs of old and new oblique aerial photographs, we have found that across this region spanning 620~km east to west and 350~km north to south, alder, willow, and dwarf birch have been increasing, with the change most easily detected on hill slopes and valley bottoms. Plot and remote sensing studies from the same region using the normalized difference vegetation index are consistent with the photographic results and indicate that the smaller shrubs between valleys are also increasing. In Canada, Scandinavia, and parts of Russia, there is both plot and remote sensing evidence for shrub expansion. Combined with the Alaskan results, the evidence suggests that a pan-Arctic vegetation transition is underway. If continued, this transition will alter the fundamental architecture and function of this ecosystem with important ramifications for the climate, the biota, and humans.},

  abstract = {How closely does variability in ecologically important traits reflect evolutionary divergence? The use of phylogenetic diversity (PD) to predict biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning, and more generally the use of phylogenetic information in community ecology, depends in part on the answer to this question. However, comparisons of the predictive power of phylogenetic diversity and functional diversity (FD) have not been conducted across a range of experiments. To address how phylogenetic diversity and functional trait variation control biodiversity effects on biomass production, we summarized the results of 29 grassland plant experiments where both the phylogeny of plant species used in the experiments is well described and where extensive trait data are available. Functional trait variation was only partially related to phylogenetic distances between species, and the resulting FD values therefore correlate only partially with PD. Despite these differences, FD and PD predicted biodiversity effects across all experiments with similar strength, including in subsets that excluded plots with legumes and that focused on fertilization experiments. Two- and three-trait combinations of the five traits used here (leaf nitrogen percentage, height, specific root length, leaf mass per unit area, and nitrogen fixation) resulted in the FD values with the greatest predictive power. Both PD and FD can be valuable predictors of the effect of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning, which suggests that a focus on both community trait diversity and evolutionary history can improve understanding of the consequences of biodiversity loss.},

Although recent meta-analyses questioned the generality of hump-shaped patterns, these syntheses have been criticized for failing to account for methodological differences among studies. We addressed such concerns by conducting standardized sampling in 48 herbaceous-dominated plant communities on five continents. We found no clear relationship between productivity and fine-scale (meters-2) richness within sites, within regions, or across the globe. Ecologists should focus on fresh, mechanistic approaches to understanding the multivariate links between productivity and richness.

  doi = {10.1890/15-0615},
  abstract = {Processes of spread and patterns of persistence of invasive species affect species and communities in the new environment. Predicting future rates of spread is of great interest for timely management decisions, but this depends on models that rely on understanding the processes of invasion and historic observations of spread and persistence. Unfortunately, the rates of spread and patterns of persistence are difficult to model or directly observe, especially when multiple rates of spread and diverse persistence patterns may be co-occurring over the geographic distribution of the invaded ecosystem. Remote sensing systematically acquires data over large areas at fine spatial and spectral resolutions over multiple time periods that can be used to quantify spread processes and persistence patterns. We used airborne imaging spectroscopy data acquired once a year for five years from 2004 \textendash{} 2008 to map an invaded submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) community across 2,220 km2 of waterways in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, California, and measured its spread rate and its persistence. Submerged aquatic vegetation covered 13 - 23 km2 of the waterways (6 - 11\%) every year. Yearly new growth accounted for 40 - 60\% of the SAV area, about 50\% of which survived to following year. Spread rates were overall negative and persistence decreased with time. From this dataset, we were able to identify both radial and saltatorial spread of the invaded SAV in the entire extent of the Delta over time. With both decreasing spread rate and persistence, it is possible that over time the invasion of this SAV community could decrease its ecological impact. A landscape scale approach allows measurements of all invasion fronts and the spatial anisotropies associated with spread processes and persistence patterns, without spatial interpolation, at locations both proximate and distant to the focus of invasion at multiple points in time.

  abstract = {Total forest carbon (C) storage is determined by succession, disturbances, climate, and the edaphic properties of a site or region. Forest harvesting substantially affects C dynamics; these effects may be amplified if forest harvesting is intensified to provide biofuel feedstock. We tested the effects of harvest intensity on landscape C using a simulation modeling approach that included C dynamics, multiple disturbances, and successional changes in composition. We developed a new extension for the LANDIS-II forest landscape disturbance and succession model that incorporates belowground soil C dynamics derived from the CENTURY soil model. The extension was parameterized and calibrated using data from an experimental forest in northeastern Wisconsin, USA. We simulated a 9800 ha forested landscape over 400 years with wind disturbance combined with no harvesting, harvesting with residual slash left on site (`standard harvest'), and whole-tree harvesting. We also simulated landscapes without wind disturbance and without eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) to examine the effects of detrital quantity and quality on C dynamics. We estimated changes in live C, detrital C, soil organic C, total C, and forest composition. Overall, the simulations without harvesting had substantially greater total C and continued to sequester C. Standard harvest simulations had more C than the whole tree harvest simulations. Under both harvest regimes, C accrual was not evident after 150 years. Without hemlock, SOC was reduced due to a decline in detritus and a shift in detrital chemistry. In conclusion, if the intensity of harvesting increases we can expect a corresponding reduction in potential C storage. Compositional changes due to historic circumstances (loss of hemlock) may also affect forest C although to a lesser degree than harvesting. The modeling approach presented enabled us to consider multiple, interacting drivers of landscape change and the subsequent changes in forest C.},

  abstract = {Land-use history interacts with natural forces to influence the severity of disturbance events and the rate and nature of recovery processes in tropical forests. Although we are far from an integrated view of forest recovery processes, some generalizations can be made. Recovery of forest structure and composition is relatively rapid following disturbances that primarily impact forest canopies, such as hurricanes. Recovery is considerably slower following disturbances that heavily impact soils as well as aboveground vegetation, such as bulldozing, heavy or long-term grazing, and severe fires, often with long-lasting effects on species composition. The landscape matrix plays a critical role in local recovery processes. Proximity of disturbed areas to remnant forest patches promotes more rapid recovery, which depends heavily on seed dispersal. Recovery of aboveground biomass is constrained by soil fertility and texture across regions as well as across soil types within a region. Restoration of soil fertility may be a prerequisite for forest recovery on sites with severely degraded soils. Despite evidence of rapid forest recovery following large-scale deforestation, many degraded areas of today's tropics will require human assistance to recover forest structure, species composition, and species interactions typical of mature tropical forests.},

We hypothesized that the slope of log\textendash{}log `scaling' relationships between these traits would be positive and would not differ between sites, although slope elevations might shift between habitat types.
* 2\hspace{0.6em}Amass, Rd-mass, SLA, Nmass and Pmass were positively associated in common slopes fitted across sites or rainfall zones, although rather weakly within individual sites in some cases. The relationships between Amass (and Rd-mass) with each of Nmass and SLA were partially independent of each other, with Amass (or Rd-mass) increasing with SLA at a given Nmass, or with Nmass at a given SLA (only weakly in the case of Amass). These results improve the quantification and extend the generalization of reported patterns to floras largely unlike those studied previously, with the additional contribution of including phosphorus data.
* 3\hspace{0.6em}Species from drier sites differed in several important respects. They had (i) higher leaf N and P (per dry mass or area); (ii) lower photosynthetic capacity at a given leaf N or P; (iii) higher Rd-mass at a given SLA or Amass; and (iv) lower Gs at a given Aarea (implying lower internal CO2 concentration).
* 4\hspace{0.6em}These trends can be interpreted as part of a previously undocumented water conservation strategy in species from dry habitats. By investing heavily in photosynthetic enzymes, a larger drawdown of internal CO2 concentration is achieved, and a given photosynthetic rate is possible at a lower stomatal conductance. Transpirational water use is similar, however, due to the lower-humidity air in dry sites. The benefit of the strategy is that dry-site species reduce water loss at a given Aarea, down to levels similar to wet-site species, despite occurring in lower-humidity environments. The cost of high leaf N is reflected in higher dark respiration rates and, presumably, additional costs incurred by N acquisition and increased herbivory risk.},

  abstract = {Quantification of vegetation properties plays an important role in the assessment of ecosystem functions with leaf dry mater content (LDMC) and specific leaf area (SLA) being two key functional traits. For the first time, these two leaf traits have been estimated from the airborne images (HySpex) using the INFORM radiative transfer model and Continuous Wavelet Analysis (CWA). Ground truth data, were collected for 33 sample plots during a field campaign in July 2013 in the Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany, concurrent with the hyperspectral overflight. The INFORM model was used to simulate the canopy reflectance of the test site and the simulated spectra were transformed to wavelet features by applying CWA. Next, the top 1\% strongly correlated wavelet features with the LDMC and SLA were used to develop predictive (regression) models. The two leaf traits were then retrieved using the CWA transformed HySpex imagery and the predictive models. The results were validated using R2 and the RMSE of the estimated and measured variables.

Our results revealed strong correlations between six wavelet features and LDMC, as well as between four wavelet features and SLA. The wavelet features at 1741 nm (scale 5) and 2281 nm (scale 4) were the two most strongly correlated with LDMC and SLA respectively. The combination of all the identified wavelet features for LDMC yielded the most accurate prediction (R2 = 0.59 and RMSE = 4.39\%). However, for SLA the most accurate prediction was obtained from the single most correlated feature: 2281 nm, scale 4 (R2 = 0.85 and RMSE = 4.90). Our results demonstrate the applicability of Continuous Wavelet Analysis (CWA) when inverting radiative transfer models, for accurate mapping of forest leaf functional traits.},

  abstract = {Earth is home to a remarkable diversity of plant forms and life histories, yet comparatively few essential trait combinations have proved evolutionarily viable in today's terrestrial biosphere. By analysing worldwide variation in six major traits critical to growth, survival and reproduction within the largest sample of vascular plant species ever compiled, we found that occupancy of six-dimensional trait space is strongly concentrated, indicating coordination and trade-offs. Three-quarters of trait variation is captured in a two-dimensional global spectrum of plant form and function. One major dimension within this plane reflects the size of whole plants and their parts; the other represents the leaf economics spectrum, which balances leaf construction costs against growth potential. The global plant trait spectrum provides a backdrop for elucidating constraints on evolution, for functionally qualifying species and ecosystems, and for improving models that predict future vegetation based on continuous variation in plant form and function.},

Consideration of clustering of branches into whorls is the latest addition to this model. Modification of the GORT model to include whorl orientation improves the ability to model the observed patterns of solar radiation transmission as a function of solar zenith angle and height in the canopy. Whorl orientation distributions are derived from multidirectional measurements using a geometric optical mutual shadowing model. For BOREAS test stands, model estimates and vertical measurements of photosynthetically active radiation transmittance within the canopy show (1) general decreases in transmission as solar zenith angles increase in the range of solar zenith angles dominated by beam irradiance, (2) increases in PAR transmission at very high solar zenith angles where diffuse skylight is dominant, (3) maximum scattering and absorption occur in the middle of the canopy. Model estimates match measurements from the forest floor, indicating the value of the model for providing radiation inputs to snowmelt models in forested landscapes.},

  abstract = {We used snow fences and small (1~m2) open-topped fiberglass chambers (OTCs) to study the effects of changes in winter snow cover and summer air temperatures on arctic tundra. In 1994, two 60~m long, 2.8~m high snow fences, one in moist and the other in dry tundra, were erected at Toolik Lake, Alaska. OTCs paired with unwarmed plots, were placed along each experimental snow gradient and in control areas adjacent to the snowdrifts. After 8 years, the vegetation of the two sites, including that in control plots, had changed significantly. At both sites, the cover of shrubs, live vegetation, and litter, together with canopy height, had all increased, while lichen cover and diversity had decreased. At the moist site, bryophytes decreased in cover, while an increase in graminoids was almost entirely because of the response of the sedge Eriophorum vaginatum. These community changes were consistent with results found in studies of responses to warming and increased nutrient availability in the Arctic. However, during the time period of the experiment, summer temperature did not increase, but summer precipitation increased by 28\%. The snow addition treatment affected species abundance, canopy height, and diversity, whereas the summer warming treatment had few measurable effects on vegetation. The interannual temperature fluctuation was considerably larger than the temperature increases within OTCs ($<$2$^\circ$C), however. Snow addition also had a greater effect on microclimate by insulating vegetation from winter wind and temperature extremes, modifying winter soil temperatures, and increasing spring run-off. Most increases in shrub cover and canopy height occurred in the medium snow-depth zone (0.5\textendash{}2~m) of the moist site, and the medium to deep snow-depth zone (2\textendash{}3~m) of the dry site. At the moist tundra site, deciduous shrubs, particularly Betula nana, increased in cover, while evergreen shrubs decreased. These differential responses were likely because of the larger production to biomass ratio in deciduous shrubs, combined with their more flexible growth response under changing environmental conditions. At the dry site, where deciduous shrubs were a minor part of the vegetation, evergreen shrubs increased in both cover and canopy height. These changes in abundance of functional groups are expected to affect most ecological processes, particularly the rate of litter decomposition, nutrient cycling, and both soil carbon and nitrogen pools. Also, changes in canopy structure, associated with increases in shrub abundance, are expected to alter the summer energy balance by increasing net radiation and evapotranspiration, thus altering soil moisture regimes.},

However, the utility of TLS data for the quantification of plant physiological properties remains largely unexplored. Here, we test whether the laser return intensity of green (532-nm) TLS correlates with changes in the de-epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle and photoprotective non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), and compare the ability of TLS to quantify these parameters with the passively measured photochemical reflectance index (PRI).

* We exposed leaves from five plant species to increasing light intensities to induce NPQ and de-epoxidation of violaxanthin (V) to antheraxanthin (A) and zeaxanthin (Z). At each light intensity, the green laser return intensity (GLRI), narrowband spectral reflectance, chlorophyll fluorescence emission and xanthophyll cycle pigment composition were recorded.

* Strong relationships between both predictor variables (GLRI, PRI) and both explanatory variables (NPQ, xanthophyll cycle de-epoxidation) were observed.

* GLRI holds promise to provide detailed (mm) information about plant physiological status to improve our understanding of the patterns and mechanisms driving foliar photoprotection. We discuss the potential for scaling these laboratory data to three-dimensional canopy space.},

  abstract = {Chlorophyll a+b (Ca+b) and carotenoids (Cx+c) are leaf pigments associated with photosynthesis, participation in light harvesting and energy transfer, quenching and photoprotection. This manuscript makes progress on developing methods for leaf carotenoid content estimation, using high resolution hyperspectral imagery acquired from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Imagery was acquired over 3 years using two different UAV platforms, a 6-band multispectral camera and a micro-hyperspectral imager flown with 260 bands at 1.85 nm/pixel and 12-bit radiometric resolution, yielding 40 cm pixel size and a FWHM of 6.4 nm with a 25-$\mu$m slit in the 400\textendash{}885 nm spectral region. Field data collections were conducted in August 2009\textendash{}2011 in the western area of Ribera del Duero Appellation d'Origine, northern Spain. A total of twelve full production vineyards and two study plots per field were selected to ensure appropriate variability in leaf biochemistry and vine physiological conditions. Leaves were collected for destructive sampling and biochemical determination of chlorophyll a+b and carotenoids conducted in the laboratory. In addition to leaf sampling and biochemical determination, canopy structural parameters, such as grid size, number of vines within each plot, trunk height, plant height and width, and row orientation, were measured on each 10 m \texttimes{} 10 m plot. The R515/R570 index recently proposed for carotenoid estimation in conifer forest canopies was explored for vineyards in this study. The PROSPECT-5 leaf radiative transfer model, which simulates the carotenoid and chlorophyll content effects on leaf reflectance and transmittance, was linked to the SAILH and FLIGHT canopy-level radiative transfer models, as well as to simpler approximations based on infinite reflectance R$\infty$ formulations. The objective was to simulate the pure vine reflectance without soil and shadow effects due to the high resolution hyperspectral imagery acquired from the UAV, which enabled targeting pure vines. The simulation results obtained with synthetic spectra demonstrated the effects due to Ca+b content on leaf Cx+c estimation when the R515/R570 index was used. Therefore, scaling up methods were proposed for leaf carotenoid content estimation based on the combined R515/R570 (sensitive to Cx+c) and TCARI/OSAVI (sensitive to Ca+b) narrow-band indices. Results demonstrated the feasibility of mapping leaf carotenoid concentration at the pure-vine level from high resolution hyperspectral imagery, yielding a root mean square error (RMSE) below 1.3 $\mu$g/cm2 and a relative RMSE (R-RMSE) of 14.4\% (FLIGHT) and 12.9\% (SAILH) for the 2 years of hyperspectral imagery. The simpler formulation based on the infinite reflectance model by Yamada and Fujimura yielded lower errors (RMSE = 0.87 $\mu$g/cm2; R-RMSE \&lt; 9.7\%), although the slope deviated more from the 1:1 line. Maps showing the spatial variability of leaf carotenoid content were estimated using this methodology, which targeted pure vines without shadow and background effects.},

  abstract = {* Wood contains the majority of the nutrients in tropical trees, yet controls over wood nutrient concentrations and their function are poorly understood.

* We measured wood nutrient concentrations in 106 tree species in 10 forest plots spanning a regional fertility gradient in Panama. For a subset of species, we quantified foliar nutrients and wood density to test whether wood nutrients scale with foliar nutrients at the species level, or wood nutrient storage increases with wood density as predicted by the wood economics spectrum.

* Wood nutrient concentrations varied enormously among species from fourfold in nitrogen (N) to $>$~30-fold in calcium (Ca), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg) and phosphorus (P). Community-weighted mean wood nutrient concentrations correlated positively with soil Ca, K, Mg and P concentrations. Wood nutrients scaled positively with leaf nutrients, supporting the hypothesis that nutrient allocation is conserved across plant organs. Wood P was most sensitive to variation in soil nutrient availability, and significant radial declines in wood P indicated that tropical trees retranslocate P as sapwood transitions to heartwood. Wood P decreased with increasing wood density, suggesting that low wood P and dense wood are traits associated with tree species persistence on low fertility soils.

* Substantial variation among species and communities in wood nutrient concentrations suggests that allocation of nutrients to wood, especially P, influences species distributions and nutrient dynamics in tropical forests.},

  abstract = {Vegetation traits provide critical information on ecosystem function that can be used to assess the effects of disturbance, land use, and climate change. Recent studies have demonstrated the use of spectroscopy to predict vegetation traits accurately and efficiently. To date, most spectroscopic studies have utilized data from the Visible Short Wave Infrared spectrum (VSWIR) or, occasionally, the Thermal Infrared spectrum (TIR), but not in combination. This study focuses on VSWIR and TIR synergy to evaluate the ability to predict leaf level cellulose, lignin, leaf mass per area (LMA), nitrogen, and water content across seasons. We used fresh leaves from sixteen common California shrub and tree species collected in the 2013 spring, summer, and fall seasons. The 284 samples exhibited a wide range of leaf traits as determined by standard analytical procedures: 4.2\textendash{}27.3\% for cellulose, 2.6\textendash{}22.5\% for lignin, 34.7\textendash{}388.9 g/m2 for LMA, 0.45\textendash{}3.81\% for nitrogen, and 20.2\textendash{}76.9\% for water content. For each leaf trait, partial least squares regression (PLSR) models were fit using different portions of the spectrum: VSWIR (0.35\textendash{}2.5 $\mu$m), TIR (2.5\textendash{}15.4 $\mu$m), and Full spectrum (0.35\textendash{}15.4 $\mu$m). We also fit PLSR models using spectra resampled to simulate three airborne sensors: the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS; 0.4\textendash{}2.5 $\mu$m), the Hyperspectral Thermal Emission Spectrometer (HyTES; 7.5\textendash{}12 $\mu$m), and the Hyperspectral InfraRed Imager (HyspIRI; 0.4\textendash{}12 $\mu$m). The majority of best performing models used the Full spectrum, demonstrating the value of combining TIR and VSWIR spectra for leaf trait prediction. Sensor-simulated PLSR models created with the entire data set yielded validation R2 and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) values as follows: R2 = 0.70 and RMSEP = 13.1\% for cellulose, R2 = 0.50 and RMSEP = 17.7\% for lignin, R2 = 0.56 and RMSEP = 18.3\% for LMA, R2 = 0.56 and RMSEP = 18.1\% for nitrogen, and R2 = 0.89 and RMSEP = 5.7\% for water content. General models successfully captured the variability among all seasons and leaf forms for cellulose and water content, while the other leaf traits were better modeled with season or leaf form-specific models. This study successfully captured the large seasonal and geographical variation in leaf traits across California's diverse ecosystems, supporting the possibility of using HyspIRI's imagery for global mapping efforts of these traits.},

Twelve soybean genotypes were grown at day/night temperatures of 30/22, 34/24, 38/26 and 42/28 $^\circ$C with an average temperature of 26, 29, 32 and 35 $^\circ$C, respectively, under greenhouse conditions. One set was also grown under ambient temperature conditions where crop season average maximum, minimum and mean temperatures were 28.0, 22.4 and 25.2 $^\circ$C, respectively. Significant negative effect of temperature was observed on specific leaf weight (SLW) and leaf thickness. Rate of photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and water use efficiency declined as the growing temperatures increased; whereas, intercellular CO2 and transpiration rate were increased. With the increase in temperature chlorophyll fluorescence parameters such as Fv/Fm, qP and PhiPSII declined while there was increase in qN. Number of stomata on both abaxial and adaxial surface of leaf increased significantly with increase in temperatures. The rate of photosynthesis, PhiPSII, qP and SPAD values were positively associated with leaf thickness and SLW. This indicated that reduction in photosynthesis and associated parameters appears to be due to structural changes observed at higher temperatures. The average seed yield was maximum (13.2 g/pl) in plants grown under ambient temperature condition and declined by 8, 14, 51 and 65\% as the temperature was increased to 30/22, 34/24, 38/26 and 42/28 $^\circ$C, respectively.},

  abstract = {Spatial and temporal variations in canopy structure and leaf biochemistry have considerable influence on fluxes of CO2, water and energy and nutrient cycling in vegetation. Two vegetation indices (VI), NDVI and Macc01, were used to model the spatio-temporal variability of broadleaf chlorophyll content and leaf area index (LAI) across a growing season. Ground data including LAI, hyperspectral leaf reflectance factors (400\textendash{}2500 nm) and leaf chlorophyll content were measured across the growing season and satellite-derived canopy reflectance data was acquired for 33 dates at 1200 m spatial resolution. Key phenological information was extracted using the TIMESAT software. Results showed that LAI and chlorophyll start of season (SOS) dates were at day of year (DOY) 130 and 157 respectively, and total season duration varied by 57 days. The spatial variability of chlorophyll and LAI phenology was also analyzed at the landscape scale to investigate phenological patterns over a larger spatial extent. Whilst a degree of spatial variability existed, results showed that chlorophyll SOS lagged approximately 20\textendash{}35 days behind LAI SOS, and the end of season (EOS) LAI dates were predominantly between 20 and 30 days later than chlorophyll EOS. The large temporal differences between VI-derived chlorophyll content and LAI has important implications for biogeochemical models using NDVI or LAI to represent the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by a canopy, in neglecting to account for delays in chlorophyll production and thus photosynthetic capacity.},

  abstract = {We devise a computer efficient and flexible inversion technique to retrieve vegetation canopy parameters, in particular the Leaf Area Index, from the radiance field emerging at the top of a structurally heterogeneous systems overlying an anisotropic spatially uniform surface background. The proposed inversion strategy focuses on a reanalysis of multiangle and multispectral measurements unhindered by the many specific constraints imposed by the operational application of the current algorithms and their associated limitations on data staging. This technique capitalizes on the decoupling between contributions due to the canopy only and those invoking the background reflectance properties. These contributions are decomposed into the wavelength dependent and independent contributions. A quasi-linear relationship is thus obtained between the radiance/reflectance emerging from the top of the canopy layer and the background reflectance. Although all individual contributions can be estimated from accurate three-dimensional radiation transfer models, we propose appropriate approximations in order to estimate the minor terms. These approximations exploit the relatively limited dependency exhibited by these relatively smaller contributions with respect to the azimuthal coordinate. Moreover, additional mathematical developments are proposed to further approximate these terms by their corresponding solutions obtained in the limit case of a plane-parallel turbid medium scenario. They require defining effective values of the state variables entering the plane-parallel turbid medium model. The resulting reflectance of a three-dimensional spatially heterogeneous vegetation layer is driven by a sum of contributions that can be precomputed offline on the basis of the three-dimensional and plane-parallel homogeneous turbid medium model capabilities. The decoupling of the intrinsic vegetation and the background contributions allows many of the contributions to be precomputed and stored in look-up tables. This development yields a simple and computer efficient inversion scheme that allows us to jointly retrieve the values of the main vegetation layer attributes and the underlying background radiative properties. Demonstration tests based on actual multiangular and multispectral data set are currently being investigated.},

Abstract
The global decline of biodiversity caused by human domination of ecosystems worldwide is supposed to alter important process rates and state variables in these ecosystems. However, there is considerable debate on the prevalence and importance of biodiversity effects on ecosystem function (BDEF). Here, we argue that much of the debate stems from two major shortcomings. First, most studies do not directly link the traits leading to increased or decreased function to the traits needed for species coexistence and dominance. We argue that implementing a trait-based approach and broadening the perception of diversity to include trait dissimilarity or trait divergence will result in more realistic predictions on the consequences of altered biodiversity. Second, the empirical and theoretical studies do not reflect the complexity of natural ecosystems, which makes it difficult to transfer the results to natural situations of species loss. We review how different aspects of complexity (trophic structure, multifunctionality, spatial or temporal heterogeneity, and spatial population dynamics) alter our perception of BDEF. We propose future research avenues concisely testing whether acknowledging this complexity will strengthen the observed biodiversity effects. Finally, we propose that a major future task is to disentangle biodiversity effects on ecosystem function from direct changes in function due to human alterations of abiotic constraints.},

The species studied included two light-demanding pioneers (Miconia argentea and Apeiba membranacea) and three shade-tolerant young- or old-forest species (Pouteria reticulata, Gustavia superba, and Trichilia tuberculata). Growth analysis revealed that shoot and root dry weights and hydraulic conductances and leaf area all increased exponentially with time. Alternative methods of scaling measured parameters to reveal differences that might explain adaptations to microsites are discussed. Scaling root conductance to root surface area or root length revealed a few species differences but nothing that correlated with adaptation to light regimes. Scaling of root surface area or root length to root dry weight revealed that pioneers produced significantly more root area and length per gram dry weight investment than shade-tolerant species. Scaling of root and shoot hydraulic conductances to leaf area and scaling of root conductance to root dry weight and shoot conductance to shoot dry weight also revealed that pioneers were significantly more conductive to water than shade-tolerant species. The advantages of scaling hydraulic parameters to leaf surface area are discussed in terms of the Ohm's law analogue of water flow in plants.},

  abstract = {Given the forthcoming availability of Sentinel-2 (S2) images, this paper provides a systematic comparison of retrieval accuracy and processing speed of a multitude of parametric, non-parametric and physically-based retrieval methods using simulated S2 data. An experimental field dataset (SPARC), collected at the agricultural site of Barrax (Spain), was used to evaluate different retrieval methods on their ability to estimate leaf area index (LAI). With regard to parametric methods, all possible band combinations for several two-band and three-band index formulations and a linear regression fitting function have been evaluated. From a set of over ten thousand indices evaluated, the best performing one was an optimized three-band combination according to ( $\rho$ 560 - $\rho$ 1610 - $\rho$ 2190 ) / ( $\rho$ 560 + $\rho$ 1610 + $\rho$ 2190 ) with a 10-fold cross-validation R CV 2 of 0.82 ( RMSE CV : 0.62). This family of methods excel for their fast processing speed, e.g., 0.05 s to calibrate and validate the regression function, and 3.8 s to map a simulated S2 image. With regard to non-parametric methods, 11 machine learning regression algorithms (MLRAs) have been evaluated. This methodological family has the advantage of making use of the full optical spectrum as well as flexible, nonlinear fitting. Particularly kernel-based MLRAs lead to excellent results, with variational heteroscedastic (VH) Gaussian Processes regression (GPR) as the best performing method, with a R CV 2 of 0.90 ( RMSE CV : 0.44). Additionally, the model is trained and validated relatively fast (1.70 s) and the processed image (taking 73.88 s) includes associated uncertainty estimates. More challenging is the inversion of a PROSAIL based radiative transfer model (RTM). After the generation of a look-up table (LUT), a multitude of cost functions and regularization options were evaluated. The best performing cost function is Pearson's $\chi$ -square. It led to a R 2 of 0.74 (RMSE: 0.80) against the validation dataset. While its validation went fast (0.33 s), due to a per-pixel LUT solving using a cost function, image processing took considerably more time (01:01:47). Summarizing, when it comes to accurate and sufficiently fast processing of imagery to generate vegetation attributes, this paper concludes that the family of kernel-based MLRAs (e.g. GPR) is the most promising processing approach.},

  abstract = {* Spatial variation in filters imposed by the abiotic environment causes variation in functional traits within and among plant species. This is abundantly clear for plant species along elevational gradients, where parallel abiotic selection pressures give rise to predictable variation in leaf phenotypes among ecosystems. Understanding the factors responsible for such patterns may provide insight into the current and future drivers of biodiversity, local community structure and ecosystem function.

* In order to explore patterns in trait variation along elevational gradients, we conducted a meta-analysis of published observational studies that measured three key leaf functional traits that are associated with axes of variation in both resource competition and stress tolerance: leaf mass:area ratio (LMA), leaf nitrogen content per unit mass (Nmass) and N content per unit area (Narea). To examine whether there may be evidence for a genetic basis underlying the trait variation, we conducted a review of published results from common garden experiments that measured the same leaf traits.

* Within studies, LMA and Narea tended to decrease with mean annual temperature (MAT) along elevational gradients, while Nmass did not vary systematically with MAT. Correlations among pairs of traits varied significantly with MAT: LMA was most strongly correlated with Nmass and Narea at high-elevation sites with relatively lower MAT. The strengths of the relationships were equal or greater within species relative to the relationships among species, suggesting parallel evolutionary dynamics along elevational gradients among disparate biomes. Evidence from common garden studies further suggests that there is an underlying genetic basis to the functional trait variation that we documented along elevational gradients.

* Taken together, these results indicate that environmental filtering both selects locally adapted genotypes within plant species and constrains species to elevational ranges based on their ranges of potential leaf trait values. If individual phenotypes are filtered from populations in the same way that species are filtered from regional species pools, changing climate may affect both the species and functional trait composition of plant communities.},

We sampled the leaf and root of Cunninghamia lanceolata and soils to assess their elemental and stoichiometric variables and $\delta$15N under all six conditions.ResultsBoth experimental warming and N fertilization consistently induced an increase in fine-root N, P, and N:P. The N:P ratio of the mature green-leaf and soil was 7.24\textendash{}11.63 and 4.79\textendash{}6.56, respectively. On average, C. lanceolata showed higher proportional P resorption, but lower N resorption. The $\delta$15N enrichment factor significantly increased in the warming and N addition treatments.ConclusionsN addition decrease leaf N content, and increased the plant growth, which was due to the effect of the N dilution of C. lanceolata. In subtropical regions, N-limitation affects the growth of C. lanceolata, and the concurrent increase in warming and N fertilization should help relieve N-limiting conditions.},

Here, to evaluate the strengths of these species assembly drivers, we partition trait variance across global, regional and community scales. We then test the hypothesis that, from global to community scales, the outcome of co-occurring trait convergence and divergence is highly variable across biomes and communities. Location\hspace{0.6em} Global: nine biomes ranging from subarctic highland to tropical rain forest. Methods\hspace{0.6em} We analysed functional trait diversity at progressively finer spatial scales using a global, balanced, hierarchically structured dataset from 9 biomes, 58 communities and 652 species. Analyses were based on two key leaf traits (foliar nitrogen content and specific leaf area) that are known to drive biogeochemical cycling. Results\hspace{0.6em} While 35\% of the global variance in these traits was between biomes, only 15\% was between communities within biomes and as much as 50\% occurred within communities. Despite this relatively high within-community variance in trait values, we found that trait convergence dominated over divergence at both global and regional scales through comparisons of functional trait diversity in regional and community assemblages against random (null) models of species assembly. Main conclusions\hspace{0.6em} We demonstrate that the convergence of traits occurring from global to regional assemblages can be twice as strong as that from regional to community assemblages, and argue that large differences in the nature and strength of abiotic and biotic drivers of dominant species assembly can, at least partly, explain the variable outcome of simultaneous trait convergence and divergence across sites. Ultimately, these findings stress the urgent need to extend species assembly research to address those scales where trait variance is the highest, i.e. between biomes and within communities.},

RAMI focuses on computer simulation models that mimic the interactions of radiation with plant canopies. These models are increasingly used in the development of satellite retrieval algorithms for terrestrial essential climate variables (ECVs). Rather than applying ad hoc performance metrics, RAMI-IV makes use of existing ISO standards to enhance the rigor of its protocols evaluating the quality of RT models. ISO-13528 was developed ``to determine the performance of individual laboratories for specific tests or measurements.'' More specifically, it aims to guarantee that measurement results fall within specified tolerance criteria from a known reference. Of particular interest to RAMI is that ISO-13528 provides guidelines for comparisons where the true value of the target quantity is unknown. In those cases, ``truth'' must be replaced by a reliable ``conventional reference value'' to enable absolute performance tests. This contribution will show, for the first time, how the ISO-13528 standard developed by the chemical and physical measurement communities can be applied to proficiency testing of computer simulation models. Step by step, the pre-screening of data, the identification of reference solutions, and the choice of proficiency statistics will be discussed and illustrated with simulation results from the RAMI-IV ``abstract canopy'' scenarios. Detailed performance statistics of the participating RT models will be provided and the role of the accuracy of the reference solutions as well as the choice of the tolerance criteria will be highlighted.},

  abstract = {Fire activity, in terms of intensity, frequency, and total area burned, is expected to increase with a changing climate. A challenge for landscape-level assessment of fire effects, often termed burn severity, is that current remote sensing assessments provide very little information regarding tree/vegetation physiological performance and recovery, limiting our understanding of fire effects on ecosystem services such as carbon storage/cycling. In this paper, we evaluated whether spectral indices common in vegetation stress and burn severity assessments could accurately quantify post-fire physiological performance (indicated by net photosynthesis and crown scorch) of two seedling species, Larix occidentalis and Pinus contorta. Seedlings were subjected to increasing fire radiative energy density (FRED) doses through a series of controlled laboratory surface fires. Mortality, physiology, and spectral reflectance were assessed for a month following the fires, and then again at one year post-fire. The differenced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (dNDVI) spectral index outperformed other spectral indices used for vegetation stress and burn severity characterization in regard to leaf net photosynthesis quantification, indicating that landscape-level quantification of tree physiology may be possible. Additionally, the survival of the majority of seedlings in the low and moderate FRED doses indicates that fire-induced mortality is more complex than the currently accepted binary scenario, where trees survive with no impacts below a certain temperature and duration threshold, and mortality occurs above the threshold.},

  abstract = {The potential of the CCM-200 chlorophyll meter for providing accurate estimates of total nitrogen concentrations was studied from 2009 to 2011 using pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) leaves collected in a field trial near Zagreb, Croatia. A fertilization treatment carried out in early spring 2009 and in variable weather conditions caused between-year differences in acorn yield and production of second and third flush shoots. A total of 10 linear calibration equations were constructed based on data from leaves sampled in early July (first flush leaves), in mid-August (second flush leaves) and in mid-September (first and second flush leaves). These equations reliably described (p $<$ 0.001) the relationships between chlorophyll content index values (CCI) measured by the chlorophyll meter and leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) with respect to the year and month of sampling. The results suggest that variable seasonal dynamics of LNC are influenced by second and/or third flushes as well as by acorn yield. This finding has negative consequences for applying the chlorophyll meter as a suitable tool for LNC assessments during a growing season or over several growing seasons. However, the chlorophyll meter still proved to be a potentially useful tool for LNC estimations, but only when calibration equations were constructed based on the first flush leaves sampled in mid-September (in the last third of a growing season).},

Abstract
Despite the increasing importance of functional traits for the study of plant ecology, we do not know how variation in a given trait changes across ecological scales, which prevents us from assessing potential scale-dependent aspects of trait variation. To address this deficiency, we partitioned the variance in two key functional traits (leaf mass area and leaf dry matter content) across six nested ecological scales (site, plot, species, tree, strata and leaf) in lowland tropical rainforests. In both traits, the plot level shows virtually no variance despite high species turnover among plots and the size of within-species variation (leaf~+~strata~+~tree) is comparable with that of species level variation. The lack of variance at the plot level brings substantial support to the idea that trait-based environmental filtering plays a central role in plant community assembly. These results and the finding that the amount of within-species variation is comparable with interspecific variation support a shift of focus from species-based to trait-based ecology.},

The seasonality question provides an important threshold test to advance predictions of tropical forest response to future climate changes. Despite its importance, spatial and temporal photosynthesis patterns in tropical forests are highly uncertain and remain controversial as ecosystem models yield divergent results while satellite-based observations are subject to various artifacts associated with cloud leakage, aerosols, and sensor-sun observation geometries. In this research, in situ seasonal tower carbon flux and leaf-scale phenology measures from cameras were combined with satellite data to investigate the roles of climate drivers and biologic processes (leaf phenology and demography traits) on vegetation canopy photosynthesis. Our results show the importance of phenology traits on controls on seasonal photosynthesis.},

To support the research and development required to domesticate and cultivate crops for bioenergy, we developed the Biofuel Ecophysiological Traits and Yields database (BETYdb). BETYdb is a centralized open-access repository that facilitates organization, discovery, and exchange of information about plant traits, crop yields, and ecosystem functions. BETYdb provides user interfaces to simplify storage and discovery as well as programming interfaces that support automated and reproducible scientific workflows. Presently, BETYdb contains over forty thousand observations of plant traits, biomass yields, and ecosystem dynamics collected from the published articles and ongoing field studies. Over half of these records represent fewer than ten genera that have been intensively evaluated for biomass production, while the other half represent over two thousand plant species reflecting research on new crops, unmanaged ecosystems, and land use transitions associated with bioenergy. BETYdb has been accessed over twenty-five thousand times and is used in the fields of bioenergy and ecosystem ecology to quantify yield potential and ecosystem functioning of crops and unmanaged systems under present and future climates. Here, we summarize the database contents and illustrate its applications. We show its utility in a new analysis that confirms that Miscanthus is twice as productive as switchgrass over a much wider range of environmental and management conditions than covered in previous analyses. We compare traits related to carbon uptake and water use of these species with each other and with two coppice shrubs, poplar and willow. These examples, along with a growing body of published research that used BETYdb, illustrate the scope of research supported through this open-access database.},

  abstract = {The PROSPECT radiative transfer model was widely used to estimate leaf biochemical parameters, such as chlorophyll, leaf mass per area (LMA) and equivalent water thickness (EWT). Many studies have reported that LMA is the most difficult to retrieve from PROSPECT primarily because the dry matter absorption features on the reflectance spectra of fresh leaves are largely masked by stronger water absorption. This study proposed a new inversion method by integrating the continuous wavelet analysis into the PROSPECT inversion process. Instead of using reflectance directly as for most studies, this method used the wavelet coefficient spectra from continuous wavelet transform for constructing the merit function for inversion. The performance of the new method was evaluated with a multi-species dataset (LOPEX) and a single-species dataset (Wheat). The results demonstrated that the wavelet-based inversion method yielded higher accuracies than traditional methods and better consistency between data sets. This inversion method has great potential for developing portable instruments to predict foliar biomass of crops without the need of calibration models.},

  abstract = {This study provides insight into the key variables that drive sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) emanating from vegetation canopies, based on a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) of the Soil-Canopy Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy (SCOPE) balance model. An updated version of the SCOPE model was used here (v1.53) which contains novel leaf physiological modules for determination of the steady state fluorescence yield: a photosynthesis model coupled with (a) submodels having empirically derived relationships, identified as TB12 for unstressed and TB12-D for drought conditions and (b) a mechanistic (MD12) submodel based on theoretical relationships. By inspecting Sobol's total order (main effect and all the interactions) sensitivity index (STi) rankings, the influential and non-influential variables were determined. Two experiments were conducted for the different leaf physiology modules in SCOPE considering (1) only vegetation variables, and (2) all SCOPE variables, i.e., including micrometeorological, aerodynamic and geometry variables.

Considering TB12-D STi results using only vegetation input variables, the canopy-leaving broadband (641\textendash{}800 nm) SIF variability was determined mainly by leaf optical properties and canopy structural variables. The most important variables were (with decreasing importance) leaf chlorophyll content (Cab), leaf inclination (LIDFa) and leaf area index (LAI). These three variables alone determined 77.9\% of the SIF variability. Vcmo, the variable related to photosynthetic capacity, determined 11.4\% of overall SIF variability, and its importance declined considerably when moving from the first emission peak (SIFred; with maximal relevance of 17.9\% at 676 nm) to the second emission peak (SIFNIR; e.g., 9.6\% at 740 nm). Stronger relationships with Vcmo were obtained when retrieving the full broadband SIF flux and calculating total fluorescence yield (Fyield, determined as the integral of the hemispherical broadband SIF flux divided by the total absorbed PAR), of which 35\% of the variability was influenced by Vcmo. Using the TB12 submodel, the major drivers of SIF flux were similar to TB12-D except that Vcmo accounted for very little (\&lt; 2\%) variability. The MD12 submodel identified the components of long-term PSII photoprotection and photodamage as the dominant factors for SIF variability: these two variables alone accounted for 51.4\% of the variability of SIF flux and 61\% of Fyield, whereas Vcmo explained only 9.7\% and 10.9\% of variability in SIF flux and Fyield, respectively.

Analysis of the relative importance of all SCOPE variables revealed that in addition to the key vegetation variables, micrometeorological variables were important in driving SIF variability, especially incoming shortwave radiation (Rin) and to a lesser extent air temperature (Ta), atmospheric vapor pressure (ea) and atmospheric CO2 concentration (Ca). Their impact further reduced the relative importance of Vcmo.

The GSA experiments led to the following conclusions: (1) explicit knowledge of key variables driving the SIF flux is essential in order to achieve unbiased SIF interpretation related to photosynthetic activity at local and global scales; (2) information related to photosynthetic activity is found more in the first emission peak (SIFred) than in the second peak (SIFNIR), and more in the full broadband SIF emission, which allows calculation of Fyield, than in individual wavebands.},

In this study, we combined two recent advances in remote sensing and ecosystem modeling to improve model carbon stock and flux estimates at a tropical forest study site at La Selva, Costa Rica (10$^\circ$25${'}$ N, 84$^\circ$00${'}$ W). Airborne lidar remote sensing was used to measure spatial heterogeneity in the vertical structure of vegetation. The ecosystem demography model (ED) was used to estimate the consequences of this heterogeneity for regional estimates of carbon stocks and fluxes. Lidar data provided substantial constraints on model estimates of both carbon stocks and net carbon fluxes. Lidar-initialized ED estimates of aboveground biomass were within 1.2\% of regression-based approaches, and corresponding model estimates of net carbon fluxes differed substantially from bracketing alternatives. The results of this study provide a promising illustration of the power of combining lidar data on vegetation height with a height-structured ecosystem model. Extending these analyses to larger scales will require the development of regional and global lidar data sets, and the continued development and application of height structured ecosystem models.},

  abstract = {* 1The concept of plant functional type proposes that species can be grouped according to common responses to the environment and/or common effects on ecosystem processes. However, the knowledge of relationships between traits associated with the response of plants to environmental factors such as resources and disturbances (response traits), and traits that determine effects of plants on ecosystem functions (effect traits), such as biogeochemical cycling or propensity to disturbance, remains rudimentary.
* 2We present a framework using concepts and results from community ecology, ecosystem ecology and evolutionary biology to provide this linkage. Ecosystem functioning is the end result of the operation of multiple environmental filters in a hierarchy of scales which, by selecting individuals with appropriate responses, result in assemblages with varying trait composition. Functional linkages and trade-offs among traits, each of which relates to one or several processes, determine whether or not filtering by different factors gives a match, and whether ecosystem effects can be easily deduced from the knowledge of the filters.
* 3To illustrate this framework we analyse a set of key environmental factors and ecosystem processes. While traits associated with response to nutrient gradients strongly overlapped with those determining net primary production, little direct overlap was found between response to fire and flammability.
* 4We hypothesize that these patterns reflect general trends. Responses to resource availability would be determined by traits that are also involved in biogeochemical cycling, because both these responses and effects are driven by the trade-off between acquisition and conservation. On the other hand, regeneration and demographic traits associated with response to disturbance, which are known to have little connection with adult traits involved in plant ecophysiology, would be of little relevance to ecosystem processes.
* 5This framework is likely to be broadly applicable, although caution must be exercised to use trait linkages and trade-offs appropriate to the scale, environmental conditions and evolutionary context.

  abstract = {This pedagogical note reminds the reader that the interpretation of climate records is dependent upon understanding the behavior of stochastic processes. In particular, before concluding that one is seeing evidence for trends, shifts in the mean, or changes in oscillation periods, one must rule out the purely random fluctuations expected from stationary time series. The example of the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) is mainly used here: the spectral density is nearly white (frequency power law  $\approx$  s-0.2) with slight broadband features near 8 and 2.5 yr. By generating synthetic but stationary time series, one can see exhibited many of the features sometimes exciting attention as being of causal climate significance. Such a display does not disprove the hypothesis of climate change, but it provides a simple null hypothesis for what is seen. In addition, it is shown that the linear predictive skill for the NAO index must be very slight (less than 3\% of the variance). A brief comparison with the Southern Oscillation shows a different spectral distribution, but again a simulation has long periods of apparent systematic sign and trends.  Application of threshold-crossing statistics (Ricean) shows no contradiction to the assumption that the Darwin pressure record is statistically stationary.},

  abstract = {Most bamboo forests grow in humid climates in low-latitude tropical or subtropical monsoon areas, and they are generally located in hilly areas. Bamboo trunks are very straight and smooth, which means that bamboo forests have low structural diversity. These features are beneficial to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) microwave penetration and they provide special information in SAR imagery. However, some factors (e.g., foreshortening) can compromise the interpretation of SAR imagery. The fusion of SAR and optical imagery is considered an effective method with which to obtain information on ground objects. However, most relevant research has been based on two types of remote sensing image. This paper proposes a new fusion scheme, which combines three types of image simultaneously, based on two fusion methods: bidimensional empirical mode decomposition (BEMD) and the Gram-Schmidt transform. The fusion of panchromatic and multispectral images based on the Gram-Schmidt transform can enhance spatial resolution while retaining multispectral information. BEMD is an adaptive decomposition method that has been applied widely in the analysis of nonlinear signals and to the nonstable signal of SAR. The fusion of SAR imagery with fused panchromatic and multispectral imagery using BEMD is based on the frequency information of the images. It was established that the proposed fusion scheme is an effective remote sensing image interpretation method, and that the value of entropy and the spatial frequency of the fused images were improved in comparison with other techniques such as the discrete wavelet, {\`a}-trous, and non-subsampled contourlet transform methods. Compared with the original image, information entropy of the fusion image based on BEMD improves about 0.13\textendash{}0.38. Compared with the other three methods it improves about 0.06\textendash{}0.12. The average gradient of BEMD is 4\%\textendash{}6\% greater than for other methods. BEMD maintains spatial frequency 3.2\textendash{}4.0 higher than other methods. The experimental results showed the proposed fusion scheme could improve the accuracy of bamboo forest classification. Accuracy increased by 12.1\%, and inaccuracy was reduced by 11.0\%.},

Hence, intensive field campaigns were organized during the growing seasons of 2000, 2004, and 2005 in order to collect ground spectra and corresponding leaf chlorophyll content values, and crop growth status, as well as CASI (Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager) hyperspectral images. Acquisition dates were planned to coincide with different phenological development stages, to monitor temporal changes in crop biophysical attributes. Field spectral measurements collected were used to test and evaluate several combined indices for chlorophyll determination using hyperspectral imagery. Several index combinations were investigated using both PROSPECT-SAILH canopy simulated spectra and field measured reflectances. The relationships between leaf chlorophyll content and combined optical indices showed similar trends for both PROSPECT-SAILH simulated data and ground measured datasets. The dataset used showed that crop type had a clear influence on the establishment of predictive equations as well as on their validation. In addition to generating different predictive equations, corn and wheat data yielded contrasting agreement between estimated and measured chlorophyll contents even for the same predictive algorithm. Among the set of indices tested in this study, index combinations MCARI/OSAVI, TCI/OSAVI, MTCI/MSAVI, and R-M/MSAVI were found relatively consistent and more stable as estimators of crop chlorophyll content.},

Several key areas are reviewed in which phylogenetic information helps to resolve long-standing controversies in community ecology, challenges previous assumptions, and opens new areas of investigation. In particular, studies in phylogenetic community ecology have helped to reveal the multitude of processes driving community assembly and have demonstrated the importance of evolution in the assembly process. Phylogenetic approaches have also increased understanding of the consequences of community interactions for speciation, adaptation and extinction. Finally, phylogenetic community structure and composition holds promise for predicting ecosystem processes and impacts of global change. Major challenges to advancing these areas remain. In particular, determining the extent to which ecologically relevant traits are phylogenetically conserved or convergent, and over what temporal scale, is critical to understanding the causes of community phylogenetic structure and its evolutionary and ecosystem consequences. Harnessing phylogenetic information to understand and forecast changes in diversity and dynamics of communities is a critical step in managing and restoring the Earth's biota in a time of rapid global change.},

  abstract = {Aim\hspace{0.6em} In recent years evidence has accumulated that plant species are differentially sorted from regional assemblages into local assemblages along local-scale environmental gradients on the basis of their function and abiotic filtering. The favourability hypothesis in biogeography proposes that in climatically difficult regions abiotic filtering should produce a regional assemblage that is less functionally diverse than that expected given the species richness and the global pool of traits. Thus it seems likely that differential filtering of plant traits along local-scale gradients may scale up to explain the distribution, diversity and filtering of plant traits in regional-scale assemblages across continents. The present work aims to address this prediction. Location\hspace{0.6em} North and South America. Methods\hspace{0.6em} We combine a dataset comprising over 5.5 million georeferenced plant occurrence records with several large plant functional trait databases in order to: (1) quantify how several critical traits associated with plant performance and ecology vary across environmental gradients; and (2) provide the first test of whether the woody plants found within 1$^\circ$ and 5$^\circ$ map grid cells are more or less functionally diverse than expected, given their species richness, across broad gradients. Results\hspace{0.6em} The results show that, for many of the traits studied, the overall distribution of functional traits in tropical regions often exceeds the expectations of random sampling given the species richness. Conversely, temperate regions often had narrower functional trait distributions than their smaller species pools would suggest. Main conclusion\hspace{0.6em} The results show that the overall distribution of function does increase towards the equator, but the functional diversity within regional-scale tropical assemblages is higher than that expected given their species richness. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that abiotic filtering constrains the overall distribution of function in temperate assemblages, but tropical assemblages are not as tightly constrained.},

  abstract = {The remote monitoring of plant canopies is critically needed for understanding of terrestrial ecosystem mechanics and biodiversity as well as capturing the short- to long-term responses of vegetation to disturbance and climate change. A variety of orbital, sub-orbital, and field instruments have been used to retrieve optical spectral signals and to study different vegetation properties such as plant biochemistry, nutrient cycling, physiology, water status, and stress. Radiative transfer models (RTMs) provide a mechanistic link between vegetation properties and observed spectral features, and RTM spectral inversion is a useful framework for estimating these properties from spectral data. However, existing approaches to RTM spectral inversion are typically limited by the inability to characterize uncertainty in parameter estimates. Here, we introduce a Bayesian algorithm for the spectral inversion of the PROSPECT 5 leaf RTM that is distinct from past approaches in two important ways: First, the algorithm only uses reflectance and does not require transmittance observations, which have been plagued by a variety of measurement and equipment challenges. Second, the output is not a point estimate for each parameter but rather the joint probability distribution that includes estimates of parameter uncertainties and covariance structure. We validated our inversion approach using a database of leaf spectra together with measurements of equivalent water thickness (EWT) and leaf dry mass per unit area (LMA). The parameters estimated by our inversion were able to accurately reproduce the observed reflectance (RMSEVIS = 0.0063, RMSENIR-SWIR = 0.0098) and transmittance (RMSEVIS = 0.0404, RMSENIR-SWIR = 0.0551) for both broadleaved and conifer species. Inversion estimates of EWT and LMA for broadleaved species agreed well with direct measurements (CVEWT = 18.8\%, CVLMA = 24.5\%), while estimates for conifer species were less accurate (CVEWT = 53.2\%, CVLMA = 63.3\%). To examine the influence of spectral resolution on parameter uncertainty, we simulated leaf reflectance as observed by ten common remote sensing platforms with varying spectral configurations and performed a Bayesian inversion on the resulting spectra. We found that full-range hyperspectral platforms were able to retrieve all parameters accurately and precisely, while the parameter estimates of multispectral platforms were much less precise and prone to bias at high and low values. We also observed that variations in the width and location of spectral bands influenced the shape of the covariance structure of parameter estimates. Our Bayesian spectral inversion provides a powerful and versatile framework for future RTM development and single- and multi-instrumental remote sensing of vegetation.},

Plant litter decomposition is an important first step for carbon and nutrient turnover, and litter inputs and losses are essential in determining soil organic matter pools and the carbon balance in terrestrial ecosystems. Photodegradation, the photochemical mineralization of organic matter, has been recently identified as a mechanism for previously unexplained high rates of litter mass loss in arid lands; however, the global significance of this process as a control on carbon cycling in terrestrial ecosystems is not known. Here we show that, across a wide range of plant species, photodegradation enhanced subsequent biotic degradation of leaf litter. Moreover, we demonstrate that the mechanism for this enhancement involves increased accessibility to plant litter carbohydrates for microbial enzymes. Photodegradation of plant litter, driven by UV radiation, and especially visible (blue\textendash{}green) light, reduced the structural and chemical bottleneck imposed by lignin in secondary cell walls. In leaf litter from woody species, specific interactions with UV radiation obscured facilitative effects of solar radiation on biotic decomposition. The generalized effect of sunlight exposure on subsequent microbial activity, mediated by increased accessibility to cell wall polysaccharides, suggests that photodegradation is quantitatively important in determining rates of mass loss, nutrient release, and the carbon balance in a broad range of terrestrial ecosystems.},

  abstract = {A regularized canopy reflectance model (REGFLEC) is applied over a dryland irrigated agricultural system in Saudi Arabia for the purpose of retrieving leaf area index (LAI) and leaf chlorophyll content (Chll). To improve the robustness of the retrieved properties, REGFLEC was modified to 1) correct for aerosol and adjacency effects, 2) consider foliar dust effects on modeled canopy reflectances, 3) include spectral information in the red-edge wavelength region, and 4) exploit empirical LAI estimates in the model inversion. Using multi-spectral RapidEye imagery allowed Chll to be retrieved with a Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of 7.9 $\mu$g cm- 2 (16\%), based upon in-situ measurements conducted in fields of alfalfa, Rhodes grass and maize over the course of a growing season. LAI and Chll compensation effects on canopy reflectance were largely avoided by informing the inversion process with ancillary LAI inputs established empirically on the basis of a statistical machine learning technique. As a result, LAI was reproduced with good accuracy, with an overall MAD of 0.42 m2 m- 2 (12.5\%). Results highlighted the considerable challenges associated with the translation of at-sensor radiance observations to surface bidirectional reflectances in dryland environments, where issues such as high aerosol loadings and large spatial gradients in surface reflectance from bright desert soils to dark vegetated fields are often present. Indeed, surface reflectances in the visible bands were reduced by up to 60\% after correction for such adjacency effects. In addition, dust deposition on leaves required explicit modification of the reflectance sub-model to account for its influence. By implementing these model refinements, REGFLEC demonstrated its utility for within-field characterization of vegetation conditions over the challenging landscapes typical of dryland agricultural regions, offering a means through which improvements can be made in the management of these globally important systems.},

Summary

Model\textendash{}data comparisons of plant physiological processes provide an understanding of mechanisms underlying vegetation responses to climate. We simulated the physiology of a pi{\~n}on pine\textendash{}juniper woodland (Pinus edulis\textendash{}Juniperus monosperma) that experienced mortality during a 5~yr precipitation-reduction experiment, allowing a framework with which to examine our knowledge of drought-induced tree mortality. We used six models designed for scales ranging from individual plants to a global level, all containing state-of-the-art representations of the internal hydraulic and carbohydrate dynamics of woody plants. Despite the large range of model structures, tuning, and parameterization employed, all simulations predicted hydraulic failure and carbon starvation processes co-occurring in dying trees of both species, with the time spent with severe hydraulic failure and carbon starvation, rather than absolute thresholds per se, being a better predictor of impending mortality. Model and empirical data suggest that limited carbon and water exchanges at stomatal, phloem, and below-ground interfaces were associated with mortality of both species. The model\textendash{}data comparison suggests that the introduction of a mechanistic process into physiology-based models provides equal or improved predictive power over traditional process-model or empirical thresholds. Both biophysical and empirical modeling approaches are useful in understanding processes, particularly when the models fail, because they reveal mechanisms that are likely to underlie mortality. We suggest that for some ecosystems, integration of mechanistic pathogen models into current vegetation models, and evaluation against observations, could result in a breakthrough capability to simulate vegetation dynamics.},

Subsequently, this work sought to explore the robustness of integrating texture metrics and red-edge in predicting the above-ground biomass of grass growing under different levels of mowing and burning in grassland management treatments. Based on the sparse partial least squares regression algorithm, the results of this study showed that red-edge vegetation indices improved above-ground grass biomass from a root mean square error of perdition (RMSEP) of 0.83 kg/m2 to an RMSEP of 0.55 kg/m2. Texture models further improved the accuracy of grass biomass estimation to an RMSEP of 0.35 kg/m2. The combination of texture models and red-edge derivatives (red-edge-derived vegetation indices) resulted in an optimal prediction accuracy of RMSEP 0.2 kg/m2 across all grassland management treatments. These results illustrate the prospect of combining texture metrics with the red-edge in predicting grass biomass across complex grassland management treatments. This offers the detailed spatial information required for grassland policy-making and sustainable grassland management in data-scarce regions such as southern Africa.},

The main goal of this research was to assess the potential of optical spectral information from NASA's Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) to discriminate different canopy structural types. In the first phase, we assessed the relationships between optical metrics and canopy structural parameters obtained from LiDAR in terms of different canopy structural attributes (biomass (i.e., area under Vegetation Vertical Profile, VVPint), canopy height and vegetation complexity). Secondly, we identified and classified different ``canopy structural types'' by integrating several structural traits using Random Forests (RF). The study area is a heterogeneous forest in Sierra National Forest in California (USA). AVIRIS optical properties were analyzed by means of several sets of variables, including single narrow band reflectance and 1st derivative, sub-pixel cover fractions, narrow-band indices, spectral absorption features, optimized normalized difference indices and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) components. Our results demonstrate that optical data contain structural information that can be retrieved. The first principal component, used as a proxy for albedo, was the most strongly correlated optical metric with vegetation complexity, and it also correlated well with biomass (VVPint) and height. In conifer forests, the shade fraction was especially correlated to vegetation complexity, while water-sensitive optical metrics had high correlations with biomass (VVPint). Single spectral band analysis results showed that correlations differ in magnitude and in direction, across the spectrum and by vegetation type and structural variable. This research illustrates the potential of AVIRIS to analyze canopy structure and to distinguish several structural types in a heterogeneous forest. Furthermore, RF using optical metrics derived from AVIRIS proved to be a powerful technique to generate maps of structural attributes. The results emphasize the importance of using the whole optical spectrum, since all spectral regions contributed to canopy structure assessment.},

  abstract = {Concerns are rising about the capacity of species to adapt quickly enough to climate change. In long-lived organisms such as trees, genetic adaptation is slow, and how much phenotypic plasticity can help them cope with climate change remains largely unknown. Here, we assess whether, where and when phenological plasticity is and will be adaptive in three major European tree species. We use a process-based species distribution model, parameterized with extensive ecological data, and manipulate plasticity to suppress phenological variations due to interannual, geographical and trend climate variability, under current and projected climatic conditions. We show that phenological plasticity is not always adaptive and mostly affects fitness at the margins of the species' distribution and climatic niche. Under current climatic conditions, phenological plasticity constrains the northern range limit of oak and beech and the southern range limit of pine. Under future climatic conditions, phenological plasticity becomes strongly adaptive towards the trailing edges of beech and oak, but severely constrains the range and niche of pine. Our results call for caution when interpreting geographical variation in trait means as adaptive, and strongly point towards species distribution models explicitly taking phenotypic plasticity into account when forecasting species distribution under climate change scenarios.},

In contrast, the nonlinear SAT response, which is excited during both strong El Ni{\~n}o and strong La Ni{\~n}a, has negative anomalies centered over Alaska and northwestern Canada and positive anomalies over much of the United States and southern Canada. For precipitation, the linear response during El Ni{\~n}o has a positive anomaly area stretching from the east coast to the southwest coast of the United States and another positive area in northern Canada, in opposition to the negative anomaly area over much of southern Canada and northern United States, and another negative area over Alaska. In contrast, the nonlinear precipitation response, which is excited during both strong El Ni{\~n}o and strong La Ni{\~n}a, displays positive anomalies over much of the United States and southern Canada, with the main center on the west coast at around 45$^\circ$N and a weak center along the southeast coast, and negative anomalies over northwestern Canada and Alaska. The nonlinear response accounts for about one-fourth and one-third as much variance as the linear response of the SAT and precipitation, respectively. A polynomial fit further verifies the nonlinear response of both the SAT and precipitation to be mainly a quadratic response to ENSO. Both the linear and nonlinear response patterns of the SAT and precipitation are basically consistent with the circulation anomalies (the 500-mb geopotential height anomalies), detected separately by nonlinear projection. A cross-validation test shows that including the nonlinear (quadratic) response can potentially contribute to additional forecast skill over North America.},

  abstract = {Detailed monitoring of vegetation changes in ice-free areas of Antarctica is crucial to determine the effects of climate warming and increasing human presence in this vulnerable ecosystem. Remote sensing techniques are especially suitable in this distant and rough environment, with high spectral and spatial resolutions needed owing to the patchiness and similarity between vegetation elements. We analyze the reflectance spectra of the most representative vegetation elements in ice-free areas of Antarctica to assess the potential for discrimination. This research is aimed as a basis for future aircraft/satellite research for long-term vegetation monitoring. The study was conducted in the Barton Peninsula, King George Island. The reflectance of ground patches of different types of vegetation or bare ground (c. 0.25      m 2     ,     n = 30     patches per class) was recorded with a spectrophotometer measuring between 340    nm    to 1025    nm    at a resolution of 0.38     n m    . We used Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to classify the cover classes according to reflectance spectra, after reduction of the number of bands using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The first five principal components explained an accumulated 99.4\% of the total variance and were added to the discriminant function. The LDA classification resulted in c. 92\% of cases correctly classified (a hit ratio 11.9 times greater than chance). The most important region for discrimination was the visible and near ultraviolet (UV), with the relative importance of spectral bands steeply decreasing in the Near Infra-Red (NIR) region. Our study shows the feasibility of discriminating among representative taxa of Antarctic vegetation using their spectral patterns in the near UV, visible and NIR. The results are encouraging for hyperspectral vegetation mapping in Antarctica, which could greatly facilitate monitoring vegetation changes in response to a changing environment, reducing the costs and environmental impacts of field surveys.},

  doi = {10.1111/gcb.13590},
  abstract = {Accurate estimation of terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP) remains a challenge despite its importance in the global carbon cycle. Chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) has been recently adopted to understand photosynthesis and its response to the environment, particularly with remote sensing data. However, it remains unclear how ChlF and photosynthesis are linked at different spatial scales across the growing season. We examined seasonal relationships between ChlF and photosynthesis at the leaf, canopy, and ecosystem scales and explored how leaf-level ChlF was linked with canopy-scale solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) in a temperate deciduous forest at Harvard Forest, Massachusetts, USA. Our results show that ChlF captured the seasonal variations of photosynthesis with significant linear relationships between ChlF and photosynthesis across the growing season over different spatial scales (R2~=~0.73, 0.77, and 0.86 at leaf, canopy, and satellite scales, respectively; P~$<$~0.0001). We developed a model to estimate GPP from the tower-based measurement of SIF and leaf-level ChlF parameters. The estimation of GPP from this model agreed well with flux tower observations of GPP (R2~=~0.68; P~$<$~0.0001), demonstrating the potential of SIF for modeling GPP. At the leaf scale, we found that leaf Fq'/Fm', the fraction of absorbed photons that are used for photochemistry for a light-adapted measurement from a pulse amplitude modulation fluorometer, was the best leaf fluorescence parameter to correlate with canopy SIF yield (SIF/APAR, R2~=~0.79; P~$<$~0.0001). We also found that canopy SIF and SIF-derived GPP (GPPSIF) were strongly correlated to leaf-level biochemistry and canopy structure, including chlorophyll content (R2~=~0.65 for canopy GPPSIF and chlorophyll content; P~$<$~0.0001), leaf area index (LAI) (R2~=~0.35 for canopy GPPSIF and LAI; P~$<$~0.0001), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (R2~=~0.36 for canopy GPPSIF and NDVI; P~$<$~0.0001). Our results suggest that ChlF can be a powerful tool to track photosynthetic rates at leaf, canopy, and ecosystem scales.},

Actionable information about crop and field status must be acquired at high spatial resolution and at a temporal frequency appropriate for timely responses. In this study, high spatial resolution imagery was obtained through the use of a small, unmanned aerial system called AggieAirTM. Simultaneously with the AggieAir flights, intensive ground sampling for plant chlorophyll was conducted at precisely determined locations. This study reports the application of a relevance vector machine coupled with cross validation and backward elimination to a dataset composed of reflectance from high-resolution multi-spectral imagery (VIS\textendash{}NIR), thermal infrared imagery, and vegetative indices, in conjunction with in situ SPAD measurements from which chlorophyll concentrations were derived, to estimate chlorophyll concentration from remotely sensed data at 15-cm resolution. The results indicate that a relevance vector machine with a thin plate spline kernel type and kernel width of 5.4, having LAI, NDVI, thermal and red bands as the selected set of inputs, can be used to spatially estimate chlorophyll concentration with a root-mean-squared-error of 5.31 $\mu$g cm-2, efficiency of 0.76, and 9 relevance vectors.},

Using a winter 2006 waterbird survey, we examined the relationships among metrics of bird community diversity and abundance and landscape characteristics of 51 wetland sub-lakes derived by an object-based classification of Landsat satellite data. Relative importance of predictors and their sets was assessed using information-theoretic model selection and the Akaike Information Criterion. Ordinary least squares regression models were diagnosed and corrected for spatial autocorrelation using spatial autoregressive lag and error models. The strongest and most consistent landscape predictors included Normalized Difference Vegetation Index for mudflat (negative effect) and emergent grassland (positive effect), total sub-lake area (positive effect), and proportion of submerged vegetation (negative effect). Significant spatial autocorrelation in linear regression was associated with local clustering of response and predictor variables, and should be further explored for selection of wetland sampling units and management of protected areas. Overall, results corroborate the utility of remote sensing to elucidate potential indicators of waterbird diversity that complement logistically challenging ground observations and offer new hypotheses on factors underlying community distributions.},

We examine how current ecological models and theories incorporate intraspecific variation, review existing data sources that could help parameterize models that account for intraspecific variation in global change predictions, and discuss new data that may be needed. We provide guidelines on when it is most important to consider intraspecific variation, such as when trait variation is heritable or when nonlinear relationships are involved. We also highlight benefits and limitations of different model types and argue that many common modeling approaches such as matrix population models or global dynamic vegetation models can allow a stronger consideration of intraspecific trait variation if the necessary data are available. We recommend that existing data need to be made more accessible, though in some cases, new experiments are needed to disentangle causes of variation.},

  abstract = {* The scarcity of empirical data on leaf respiration (R) and its temperature sensitivity (e.g. Q10, defined as the proportional increase in R per 10~$^\circ$C warming) causes uncertainty in current estimates of net primary productivity of tropical forests.

* We measured temperature response curves of R on 123 upper-canopy leaves of 28 species of trees and lianas from a tropical forest in Panama and analysed variations in R and Q10 in relation to other leaf functional traits.

* Respiration rates per leaf area at 25~$^\circ$C (RA) varied widely among species and were significantly higher in trees than in lianas. RA was best predicted by a multiple regression model containing leaf phosphorus concentration, photosynthetic capacity and leaf mass per area (r2~=~0$\cdot$64). The mean Q10 value (2$\cdot$4) was significantly higher than the commonly assumed value of 2$\cdot$0. Q10 was best predicted by the combination of leaf carbohydrate concentration and growth form (trees vs lianas) (r2~=~0$\cdot$26).

* The night-time leaf respiratory carbon flux from this tropical forest was calculated from these multiple regression models to be 4$\cdot$5~Mg~C~ha-1~year-1, with an estimated additional 2$\cdot$9~Mg~C~ha-1~year-1 being released by respiration during the day.

* Trait-based modelling has potential for estimating R, thus facilitating carbon flux estimation in species-rich tropical forests. However, in contrast to global analyses, leaf phosphorus content was the most important correlate of R and not leaf nitrogen, so calibration of trait models to the tropics will be important. Leaf traits are poor predictors of Q10 values, and more empirical data on the temperature sensitivity of respiration are critically needed to further improve our ability to scale temperature-dependent respiration in species-rich tropical forests.},

Climate change is expected to intensify the hydrological cycle and to alter evapotranspiration, with implications for ecosystem services and feedback to regional and global climate. Evapotranspiration changes may already be under way, but direct observational constraints are lacking at the global scale. Until such evidence is available, changes in the water cycle on land\textemdash{}a key diagnostic criterion of the effects of climate change and variability\textemdash{}remain uncertain. Here we provide a data-driven estimate of global land evapotranspiration from 1982 to 2008, compiled using a global monitoring network, meteorological and remote-sensing observations, and a machine-learning algorithm. In addition, we have assessed evapotranspiration variations over the same time period using an ensemble of process-based land-surface models. Our results suggest that global annual evapotranspiration increased on average by 7.1 $\pm$ 1.0 millimetres per year per decade from 1982 to 1997. After that, coincident with the last major El Ni{\~n}o event in 1998, the global evapotranspiration increase seems to have ceased until 2008. This change was driven primarily by moisture limitation in the Southern Hemisphere, particularly Africa and Australia. In these regions, microwave satellite observations indicate that soil moisture decreased from 1998 to 2008. Hence, increasing soil-moisture limitations on evapotranspiration largely explain the recent decline of the global land-evapotranspiration trend. Whether the changing behaviour of evapotranspiration is representative of natural climate variability or reflects a more permanent reorganization of the land water cycle is a key question for earth system science.},

Data were acquired by smartphone camera in Iowa State University maize fields. Various indices were extracted and their correlation with Chl content were examined by Minolta SPAD-502. Hue index in SAP reached R2 value of 0.59. However, with light-aided SAP (LASAP), R2 of 0.97 was obtained. Among traits, the vegetation index gave the most accurate indication. We can conclude that the high performance of LASAP method for estimating Chl content, leads to new opportunities offered by smart phones at much lower cost. This is a highly accurate alternative to SPAD meters for estimating Chl content nondestructively.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing products, such as the fraction of reflected solar radiation flux, as well as the amount of radiation absorbed in the photosynthetically active spectral region and the Leaf Area Index (LAI), are operationally available from Space Agencies. Climate models may benefit from these products provided their one dimensional (1-D) radiation transfer schemes effectively represent the three dimensional (3-D) effects implied by the internal spatial variability of vegetation canopies, e.g., the leaf area density, at all scales and resolutions involved (say from 1 to 100 kilometers). Failing to do so leads to inherent inconsistencies between the domain-averaged reflected and absorbed fluxes, and the implied Leaf Area Index. We propose a comprehensive approach which introduces a parameterization of the internal variability of the LAI in the 1-D representation of the radiation scheme, called a domain-averaged structure factor, and provides a description of the radiant fluxes fully consistent with the LAI specified by remote sensing. We take this opportunity to revisit and update the two-stream formulations implemented in climate models to accurately estimate the fractions of radiation absorbed separately by the vegetation canopy and the underlying surface. This is achieved by isolating the contributions of the vegetation canopy alone, the background as seen through the canopy gaps and the multiple scattering between the vegetation layer and the background. The performance of this formulation is evaluated against results from Monte Carlo simulations relative to explicit realistic 3-D canopies to show that the proposed scheme correctly simulates both the amplitude and the angular variations of all radiant fluxes with respect to the solar zenith angle.},

Field-based phenotyping platforms are being evaluated for their ability to deliver the necessary throughput for large scale experiments and to provide an accurate depiction of trait performance in real-world environments. We developed a dual-camera high throughput phenotyping (HTP) platform on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and collected time course multispectral images for large scale soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] breeding trials. We used a supervised machine learning model (Random Forest) to measure crop geometric features and obtained high correlations with final yield in breeding populations (r = 0.82). The traditional yield estimation model was significantly improved by incorporating plot row length as covariate (p \&lt; 0.01). We developed a binary prediction model from time-course multispectral HTP image data and achieved over 93\% accuracy in classifying soybean maturity. This prediction model was validated in an independent breeding trial with a different plot type. These results show that multispectral data collected from the UAV-based HTP platform could improve yield estimation accuracy and maturity recording efficiency in a modern soybean breeding program.},

  volume = {125},

  doi = {10.1111/oik.02760},
  abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated that the presence or abundance of specific genotypes, populations, species and phylogenetic clades may influence community and ecosystem properties such as resilience or productivity. Many ecological studies, however, use simple linear models to test for such relationships, including species identity as the predictor variable and some measured trait or function as the response variable without accounting for the nestedness of genetic variation across levels of organization. This omission may lead to incorrect inference about which source of variation influences community and ecosystem properties. Here, we explicitly compare this common approach to alternative ways of modeling variation in trait data, using simulated trait data and empirical results of common-garden trials using multiple levels of genetic variation within Eucalyptus, Populus and Picea. We show that: 1) when nested variation is ignored, an incorrect conclusion of species effect is drawn in up to 20\% of cases; 2) overestimation of the species effect increases \textendash{} up to 60\% in some scenarios \textendash{} as the nested term explains more of the variation; and 3) the sample sizes needed to overcome these potential problems associated with aggregating nested hierarchical variation may be impractically large. In common-garden trials, incorporating nested models increased explanatory power twofold for mammal browsing rate in Eucalyptus, threefold for leaf area in Populus, and tenfold for branch number in Picea. Thoroughly measuring intraspecific variation and characterizing hierarchical genetic variation beyond the species level has implications for developing more robust theory in community ecology, managing invaded natural systems, and improving inference in biodiversity\textendash{}ecosystem functioning research. 
Synthesis
Until recently, ecologists acknowledged the ubiquity of within-species trait variation, but paid scant attention to how much it affects communities and ecosystems. Here, the authors used simulated trait data and common-garden studies to demonstrate that we ignore intraspecific trait variation at our peril. In both simulated and experimental systems, in many cases ignoring intraspecific variation led to incorrect statistical inferences and inflated the effect size of species identity.
This study shows that ecologists must characterize hierarchically nested genetic and phenotypic variation to fully understand the links between individual traits, community structure and ecosystem functioning.},

  abstract = {Canopy height (Hcanopy) and aboveground biomass (AGB) of crops are two basic agro-ecological indicators that can provide important indications on the growth, light use efficiency, and carbon stocks in agro-ecosystems. In this study, hundreds of stereo images with very high resolution were collected to estimate Hcanopy and AGB of maize using a low-cost unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system. Millions of point clouds that are related to the structure from motion (SfM) were produced from the UAV stereo images through a photogrammetric workflow. Metrics that are commonly used in airborne laser scanning (ALS) were calculated from the SfM point clouds and were tested in the estimation of maize parameters for the first time. In addition, the commonly used spectral vegetation indices calculated from the UAV orthorectified image were also tested. Estimation models were established based on the UAV variables and field measurements with cross validation, during which the performance of the UAV variables was quantified. Finally, the following results were achieved: (1) the spatial patterns of maize Hcanopy and AGB were predicted by a multiple stepwise linear (SWL) regression model (R2 = 0.88, rRMSE = 6.40\%) and a random forest regression (RF) model (R2 = 0.78, rRMSE = 16.66\%), respectively. (2) The UAV-estimated maize parameters were proved to be comparable to the field measurements with a mean error (ME) of 0.11 m for Hcanopy, and 0.05 kg/m2 for AGB. (3) The SfM point metrics, especially the mean point height (Hmean) greatly contributed to the estimation model of maize Hcanopy and AGB, which can be promising indicators in the detection of maize biophysical parameters. To conclude, the variations in spectral and structural attributes for maize canopy should be simultaneously considered when only simple RGB images are available for estimating maize AGB. This study provides some suggestions on how to make full use of the low-cost and high-resolution UAV stereo images in precision agro-ecological applications and management.},

1
Human-altered landscapes dominate the planet, yet little is known about their capacity to sustain plant functional diversity. Most conservation-orientated studies of such landscapes focus on species diversity, whereas less attention is given to functional traits and their conservation.

*
2
We examine the functional diversity of herbaceous and shrubby plant communities in three forest habitats (understorey, tree-fall gaps and riverbanks) and three deforested habitats (pasture, roadside vegetation and pasture riverbanks), each replicated in three human-dominated landscapes in southern Costa Rica. We focus on six categorical traits related to forest regeneration, reproduction and dispersal: pollination mechanism, dispersal mechanism, growth form, fruit type, fruit size and seed size.

*
3
We compared trait state richness and composition of each trait in forested and deforested habitats and how three pollination states (bat, bird and bee pollination) and three dispersal states (fur, bird and monkey dispersal) of conservation interest were distributed across these landscapes.

*
4
Only one trait state was missing from forest, and none was missing from deforested habitats. Understorey and pasture were consistently trait state poor. Forested and deforested plots differed in trait state composition for all traits. Pasture riverbanks and road verges were compositionally similar to forest riverbanks and tree-fall gaps, for multiple traits. There were more compositional similarities between forested and deforested habitat types when abundance of individuals with a trait state was used as the basis for similarity measures than when the number of species with each trait state was used. Bat-, bird- and bee-pollinated plants and plants with bird- and monkey-dispersed fruits were most common in forest and pasture riverbanks whereas species with fur-dispersed seeds were more common in all deforested habitats.

*
5
Functional diversity patterns were inconsistent across habitat types and locations but overall functional similarity was high between forested and deforested communities. Patterns of functional diversity were far more variable between habitats and landscapes than the consistent patterns found previously for species diversity.},

We used the US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis database to evaluate the drivers of tree mortality for eastern temperate forest at the individual-level across spatial scales from tree to landscape to region. We investigated 13 covariates in four categories: climate, air pollutants, topography, and stand characteristics. Overall, we found that tree mortality was most sensitive to stand characteristics and air pollutants. Different functional groups also varied considerably in their sensitivity to environmental drivers. This research highlights the importance of considering the interactions among multiple global change agents in shaping forest ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Outputs from coupled general circulation models (CGCMs) are used in examining tropical Pacific decadal variability (TPDV) and their relationships with El Ni{\~n}o\textendash{}Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Herein TPDV is classified as either ENSO-induced TPDV (EIT) or ENSO-like TPDV (ELT), based on their correlations with a decadal modulation index of ENSO amplitude and spatial pattern. EIT is identified by the leading EOF mode of the low-pass filtered equatorial subsurface temperature anomalies and is highly correlated with the decadal ENSO modulation index. This mode is characterized by an east\textendash{}west dipole structure along the equator. ELT is usually defined by the first EOF mode of subsurface temperature, of which the spatial structure is similar to ENSO. Generally, this mode is insignificantly correlated with the decadal modulation of ENSO. EIT closely interacts with the residuals induced by ENSO asymmetries, both of which show similar spatial structures. On the other hand, ELT is controlled by slowly varying ocean adjustments analogous to a recharge oscillator of ENSO. Both types of TPDV have similar spectral peaks on a decadal-to-interdecadal time scale. Interestingly, the variances of both types of TPDV depend on the strength of connection between El Ni{\~n}o\textendash{}La Ni{\~n}a residuals and EIT, such that the strong two-way feedback between them enhances EIT and reduces ELT. The strength of the two-way feedback is also related to ENSO variability. The flavors of El Ni{\~n}o\textendash{}La Ni{\~n}a with respect to changes in the tropical Pacific mean state tend to be well simulated when ENSO variability is larger in CGCMs. As a result, stronger ENSO variability leads to intensified interactive feedback between ENSO residuals and enhanced EIT in CGCMs.},

  abstract = {In response to the urgent need for improved mapping of global biomass and the lack of any current space systems capable of addressing this need, the BIOMASS mission was proposed to the European Space Agency for the third cycle of Earth Explorer Core missions and was selected for Feasibility Study (Phase A) in March 2009. The objectives of the mission are 1) to quantify the magnitude and distribution of forest biomass globally to improve resource assessment, carbon accounting and carbon models, and 2) to monitor and quantify changes in terrestrial forest biomass globally, on an annual basis or better, leading to improved estimates of terrestrial carbon sources (primarily from deforestation); and terrestrial carbon sinks due to forest regrowth and afforestation. These science objectives require the mission to measure above-ground forest biomass from 70$^\circ$ N to 56$^\circ$ S at spatial scale of 100\textendash{}200 m, with error not exceeding $\pm$ 20\% or $\pm$ 10 t ha- 1 and forest height with error of $\pm$ 4 m. To meet the measurement requirements, the mission will carry a P-Band polarimetric SAR (centre frequency 435 MHz with 6 MHz bandwidth) with interferometric capability, operating in a dawn-dusk orbit with a constant incidence angle (in the range of 25$^\circ$\textendash{}35$^\circ$) and a 25\textendash{}45 day repeat cycle. During its 5-year lifetime, the mission will be capable of providing both direct measurements of biomass derived from intensity data and measurements of forest height derived from polarimetric interferometry. The design of the BIOMASS mission spins together two main observational strands: (1) the long heritage of airborne observations in tropical, temperate and boreal forest that have demonstrated the capabilities of P-band SAR for measuring forest biomass; (2) new developments in recovery of forest structure including forest height from Pol-InSAR, and, crucially, the resistance of P-band to temporal decorrelation, which makes this frequency uniquely suitable for biomass measurements with a single repeat-pass satellite. These two complementary measurement approaches are combined in the single BIOMASS sensor, and have the satisfying property that increasing biomass reduces the sensitivity of the former approach while increasing the sensitivity of the latter. This paper surveys the body of evidence built up over the last decade, from a wide range of airborne experiments, which illustrates the ability of such a sensor to provide the required measurements.
At present, the BIOMASS P-band radar appears to be the only sensor capable of providing the necessary global knowledge about the world's forest biomass and its changes. In addition, this first chance to explore the Earth's environment with a long wavelength satellite SAR is expected to make yield new information in a range of geoscience areas, including subsurface structure in arid lands and polar ice, and forest inundation dynamics.},

When these data were compared with active fluorescence measurements performed on needles they revealed the same trend. During sunny days fluorescence and reflectance signals were found to be strongly influenced by shadows associated with the canopy structure. Moreover, chlorophyll fluorescence variations induced by rapid light changes (due to transient cloud shadows) were found to respond more quickly and with larger amplitude under summer conditions compared to those obtained under cold acclimation conditions. In addition, ChlF at 760 nm was observed to increase with the chlorophyll content. During this campaign, the CO2 assimilation was measured at the forest canopy level and was found remarkably well correlated with the PRI index.},

  abstract = {* Theory predicts that natural selection should favor coordination between leaf physiology, biochemistry and anatomical structure along a functional trait spectrum from fast, resource-acquisitive syndromes to slow, resource-conservative syndromes. However, the coordination hypothesis has rarely been tested at a phylogenetic scale most relevant for understanding rapid adaptation in the recent past or for the prediction of evolutionary trajectories in response to climate change.

* We used a common garden to examine genetically based coordination between leaf traits across 19 wild and cultivated tomato taxa.

* We found weak integration between leaf structure (e.g. leaf mass per area) and physiological function (photosynthetic rate, biochemical capacity and CO2 diffusion), even though all were arrayed in the predicted direction along a `fast\textendash{}slow' spectrum.

* This suggests considerable scope for unique trait combinations to evolve in response to new environments or in crop breeding. In particular, we found that partially independent variation in stomatal and mesophyll conductance may allow a plant to improve water-use efficiency without necessarily sacrificing maximum photosynthetic rates. Our study does not imply that functional trait spectra, such as the leaf economics spectrum, are unimportant, but that many important axes of variation within a taxonomic group may be unique and not generalizable to other taxa.},

Such information is essential in designing effective strategies for biodiversity conservation and management. Remote sensing is one of the most powerful approaches to identify biodiversity hotspots and predict changes in species composition in reduced time and costs. This is because, with respect to field-based methods, it allows to derive complete spatial coverages of the Earth surface under study in a short period of time. Furthermore, remote sensing provides repeated coverages of field sites, thus making studies of temporal changes in biodiversity possible. In this paper we discuss, from a conceptual point of view, the potential of remote sensing in estimating biodiversity using various diversity indices, including alpha- and beta-diversity measurements.},

NASA is responsible for building and launching the LDCM satellite observatory. USGS is building the ground system and will assume responsibility for satellite operations and for collecting, archiving, and distributing data following launch. The observatory will consist of a spacecraft in low-Earth orbit with a two-sensor payload. One sensor, the Operational Land Imager (OLI), will collect image data for nine shortwave spectral bands over a 185 km swath with a 30 m spatial resolution for all bands except a 15 m panchromatic band. The other instrument, the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS), will collect image data for two thermal bands with a 100 m resolution over a 185 km swath. Both sensors offer technical advancements over earlier Landsat instruments. OLI and TIRS will coincidently collect data and the observatory will transmit the data to the ground system where it will be archived, processed to Level 1 data products containing well calibrated and co-registered OLI and TIRS data, and made available for free distribution to the general public. The LDCM development is on schedule for a December 2012 launch. The USGS intends to rename the satellite ``Landsat 8'' following launch. By either name a successful mission will fulfill a mandate for Landsat data continuity. The mission will extend the almost 40-year Landsat data archive with images sufficiently consistent with data from the earlier missions to allow long-term studies of regional and global land cover change.},

A Cropscan, Inc. multispectral radiometer was used to automatically take a measurement every 1\textendash{}1.5 m. Field images of both devices were compared in their capability for detecting nitrogen variability in a wheat field that had three seeding densities and five nitrogen application rates. Every treatment had four repetitions, resulting in 60 plots of 12 m by 16 m. Due to frequent cloud cover, only one Ikonos image could be taken during the growing season. At harvest, yield variables of the plots were collected to relate to the images of both systems. Calculated normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from both measurement systems was a good indicator of applied nitrogen in the field: correlation was 0.76 and 0.85 for Ikonos and the platform, respectively. NDVI was also well correlated to yield variables at harvest. The best correlation found for both systems was with grain nitrogen content (kg[N] ha-1): 0.86 and 0.91 for Ikonos and the platform, respectively. The ground-based system provided a better estimate of nitrogen in the wheat crop and was better related to dry matter content. Ikonos images were higher correlated to straw yield and biomass. When estimating yield variables with NDVI measurements, the average error percentage was lower for the platform than for Ikonos. In conclusion, both measurement devices could be used to indicate wheat nitrogen stress by measuring canopy reflectance, but measurements of the platform were more accurate.},

  abstract = {Current coupled atmosphere\textendash{}ocean general circulation models can not simulate decadal variability well, and model errors would have a significant impact on the estimation of decadal predictability. In this study, the nonlinear local Lyapunov exponent method is adopted to estimate the limit of decadal predictability based on 9-year low-pass filtered sea surface temperature (SST) and sea level pressure (SLP) observations. The results show that the limit of decadal predictability of the SST field is relatively large in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, Southern Ocean, tropical Indian Ocean, and western North Pacific, exceeding 7 years at most locations in these regions. In contrast, the limit of the SST field is relatively small in the tropical central\textendash{}eastern Pacific (4\textendash{}6 years). Similar to the SST field, the SLP field has a relatively large limit of decadal predictability over the Antarctic, North Pacific, and tropical Indian Ocean ($>$6 years). In addition, a relatively large limit of decadal predictability of the SLP field also occurs over the land regions of Africa, India, and South America. Distributions of the limit of decadal predictability of both the SST and SLP fields are almost consistent with those of their intensity and persistence on decadal timescales. By examining the limit of decadal predictability of several major climate modes, we found that the limit of decadal predictability of the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) is about 9 years, slightly lower than that of the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) (about 11 years). In contrast, the northern and southern annular modes have limits of decadal predictability of about 4 and 9 years, respectively. However, the above limits estimated using time-filtered data may overestimate the predictability of decadal variability due to the use of time filtering. Filtered noise with the same spectral characteristics as the PDO and AMO, has a predictability of about 3 years. Future work is required with a longer period of observations or using a more realistic model of decadal variability to assess the real-time decadal predictability.},

  abstract = {1.\hspace{0.6em}One way to simplify the high taxonomic diversity of plant species in vegetation models is to place species into groups based on shared, dominant traits. Many studies have suggested that morphological and physiological traits of tropical dry forest tree species vary with leaf habit (i.e. leaves from evergreen, deciduous or semi-deciduous species) and thus this characteristic may serve as a useful way to distinguish ecologically meaningful functional types. 2.\hspace{0.6em}In this study we examine whether 10 plant traits vary with leaf habit in replicated leaves and individual trees of 87 species from a tropical dry forest in Costa Rica. We also looked for evidence of phylogenetic conservatism, i.e. closely related species sharing similar trait values compared to more distantly related taxa. 3.\hspace{0.6em}While some of the traits varied within and among individual trees of the same species, interspecific variation accounted for 57\textendash{}83\% of the variance among samples. Four traits in addition to leaf habit showed evidence of phylogenetic conservatism, but these results were strongly dependent on the inclusion of the 18 species of legumes (Fabaceae) in our dataset. Contrary to our predictions, none of the traits we measured differed among leaf habits. However, five traits (wood density, leaf C, leaf N, N/P and C/N) varied significantly between legumes and other functional types. Furthermore, when all high-nitrogen non-legume taxa were compared to the high-nitrogen legumes, six traits excluding leaf N differed significantly, indicating that legumes are functionally different from other tree species beyond high N concentrations. Similarly, the 18 legume taxa (which all have compound leaves) also differed from other compound-leaved species for six traits, thus leaf type does not explain these patterns. 4.\hspace{0.6em}Our main conclusions are that (i) a plant functional type classification based on leaf habit alone has little utility in the tropical dry forest we studied, and (ii) legumes have a different suite of traits including high leaf carbon and wood density in addition to high leaf nitrogen. Whether this result generalizes to other tropical forests is unknown, but merits future research due to the consequences of these traits for carbon storage and ecosystem processes.},

  abstract = {Relationships between the distribution and specific leaf area (SLA: leaf area per unit dry mass) of six heath (Ericaceae) species were investigated along an environmental gradient between peat bogs and conifer forest in British Columbia, Canada. I asked whether patterns in SLA could help to identify the processes shaping plant distributional patterns. Specifically, I assessed whether (i) species' distributions across the environmental gradient are correlated with SLA (ii) relationships between plant distributional patterns and SLA are similar among bogs with different shrub species (iii) intraspecific patterns in SLA parallel interspecific relationships between distributions and SLA, and (iv) intraspecific patterns are environmentally determined. Results showed that distributional patterns were often correlated with SLA; species with lower SLA were more abundant towards the centre of bogs, while species with higher SLA were more abundant in forest. Intraspecific patterns in SLA paralleled distributional patterns across the gradient; individuals located towards the centre of bogs had lower SLA than those growing in forest. A transplantation experiment showed that plants typically altered their SLA according to local environmental conditions. However, one bog showed no relationship between species' distributions and SLA. This bog lacked the two species with lowest SLA, which typically occurred at the centre of other bogs. In their absence, species with higher SLA that typically occurred in forest increased in abundance towards the centre of the bog, where they obtained lower values of SLA. Therefore, while distributional patterns were often closely associated with SLA, plasticity in SLA was associated with increased breadth of species' distributions across the gradient. Overall results indicate SLA may serve as a useful proxy for a range of life history traits to help elucidate the processes structuring plant communities.},

  abstract = {* 1We quantified neighbourhood effects on sapling growth for 60 tree species in the 50-ha plot in Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Additionally, we tested whether target sapling growth responds to taxonomic or functional identity of neighbouring species by comparing four alternate models (that all neighbours have equivalent effects on the target; that conspecific and heterospecific neighbours have distinct effects; that heterospecific neighbours can be divided into confamilials and non-confamilials; and that they can be divided according to their response to light availability).
* 2Over half of the species (34 out of 60) analysed were consistent with all neighbours having equivalent effects on the target. This may result from diffuse evolution allowing tolerance of a large number of neighbouring species or could be a statistical artefact of over-clumping species into large neighbour groups (e.g. heterospecific neighbours).
* 3Other species supported models that differentiated between conspecific and heterospecific (n~=~6) or between confamilial vs. non-confamilial (n~=~5) neighbours and, in general, effects of neighbours were stronger if they were more closely related to the target. Where target species differentiated between neighbours from different light guilds (n~=~15), effects were stronger if both belonged to the same guild (i.e. both gap requiring or both shade tolerant).
* 4Despite the fact that the majority of species did not respond to the identity of neighbours, all differed in their response to the degree of crowding. Our results suggest that the response of target species to crowding, rather than individual species effects on targets, may be subject to selection.
* 5Variation among species in response to crowding or to the identity of neighbouring species is likely to contribute to the maintenance of species diversity in tropical forests.},

Normalized canopy water-use of trees exposed to elevated CO2 over an 8-day exposure period was similar to that of trees exposed to current ambient CO2 under sunny conditions. During a portion of the exposure period when sky conditions were cloudy, CO2-exposed trees showed minor ($\leq$7\%) but significant reductions in relative sap flux density compared to trees under ambient CO2 conditions. Short-term (minutes) direct stomatal responses to elevated CO2 were also relatively weak ($\approx$5\% reduction in stomatal aperture in response to high CO2 concentrations). We observed no evidence of adjustment in stomatal conductance in foliage grown under elevated CO2 for nearly 80 days compared to foliage grown under current ambient CO2, so intrinsic leaf water-use efficiency at elevated CO2 was enhanced primarily by direct responses of photosynthesis to CO2. We did not detect statistical differences in parameters from photosynthetic responses to intercellular CO2 (A net-C i curves) for Pinus taeda foliage grown under elevated CO2 (550 $\mu$mol mol-1) for 50\textendash{}80 days compared to those for foliage grown under current ambient CO2 from similar-sized reference trees nearby. In both cases, leaf net photosynthetic rate at 550 $\mu$mol mol-1 CO2 was enhanced by approximately 65\% compared to the rate at ambient CO2 (350 $\mu$mol mol-1). A similar level of enhancement under elevated CO2 was observed for daily photosynthesis under field conditions on a sunny day. While enhancement of photosynthesis by elevated CO2 during the study period appears to be primarily attributable to direct photosynthetic responses to CO2 in the pine forest, longer-term CO2 responses and feedbacks remain to be evaluated.},

This can have an impact on light harvesting in plants, and their energy balance and water management. The horizontally oriented, hypo-stomatal leaves of Fagus sylvatica present an efficient trap for dust particles. Two-year-old seedlings were treated for 3 weeks with two different concentrations of limestone dust from a quarry (median particle size 2 $\mathrm{\mu}$m), and then, leaf optical properties and selected morphological, biochemical, and physiological traits were examined. Their adaxial and abaxial cuticle thickness and palisade/spongy parenchyma ratio were negatively correlated with dust concentration. For leaf biochemistry, chlorophyll levels were positively correlated with dust concentration, while the correlations of UV absorbing substances with dust concentration were negative. High-dust treatment positively affected the potential photochemical efficiency of photosystem II in the leaves, potentially due to lower leaf temperature. The reflectance spectra of the leaves following different dust treatments differed significantly along the visible and UV-A spectral regions, while they were most affected in the near infrared. The dust concentration explained 74 \% (p = 0.001) of the variability of the reflectance spectra and only 20 \% (p = 0.024) of the transmittance spectra. The present short-term study reveals that limestone dust can have positive effects on leaves with abaxial stomata, although the reduced photoprotection presents a risk of photoinhibition if the dust is removed by wind or water.},

Across species, [N] was positively correlated with specific leaf area (i.e., leaf area divided by dry mass; SLA) and with water concentration at saturation (WCS) in the grasslands, excluding the one succulent species. In succulent-rich vegetation on marl, SLA was correlated with [N] but not WCS, and there was a wedge-shaped relationship between [N] and WCS. Foliar [N] and [P] were positively correlated in the grasslands, but not in succulent-rich vegetation on marl. The N/P quotient varied from 8 to 29, with mean 14 in grassland on limestone and mean 26 in grassland on deep soil over gypsum. Our chief finding is that most correlations among SLA, WCS, [N] and [P] found in the non-succulent vegetation are not found in the succulent-rich vegetation. The results are discussed in relation to global patterns and the problems of defining succulence.},

  abstract = {Previous studies have suggested that solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is correlated with Gross Primary Production (GPP). However, it remains unclear to what extent this relationship is due to absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) and/or light use efficiency (LUE). Here we present the first time series of near-surface measurement of canopy-scale SIF at 760\,nm in temperate deciduous forests. SIF correlated with GPP estimated with eddy covariance at diurnal and seasonal scales (r2\,=\,0.82 and 0.73, respectively), as well as with APAR diurnally and seasonally (r2\,=\,0.90 and 0.80, respectively). SIF/APAR is significantly positively correlated with LUE and is higher during cloudy days than sunny days. Weekly tower-based SIF agreed with SIF from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (r2\,=\,0.82). Our results provide ground-based evidence that SIF is directly related to both APAR and LUE and thus GPP, and confirm that satellite SIF can be used as a proxy for GPP.},

  abstract = {The availability of nitrogen represents a key constraint on carbon cycling in terrestrial ecosystems, and it is largely in this capacity that the role of N in the Earth's climate system has been considered. Despite this, few studies have included continuous variation in plant N status as a driver of broad-scale carbon cycle analyses. This is partly because of uncertainties in how leaf-level physiological relationships scale to whole ecosystems and because methods for regional to continental detection of plant N concentrations have yet to be developed. Here, we show that ecosystem CO2 uptake capacity in temperate and boreal forests scales directly with whole-canopy N concentrations, mirroring a leaf-level trend that has been observed for woody plants worldwide. We further show that both CO2 uptake capacity and canopy N concentration are strongly and positively correlated with shortwave surface albedo. These results suggest that N plays an additional, and overlooked, role in the climate system via its influence on vegetation reflectivity and shortwave surface energy exchange. We also demonstrate that much of the spatial variation in canopy N can be detected by using broad-band satellite sensors, offering a means through which these findings can be applied toward improved application of coupled carbon cycle\textendash{}climate models.},

  abstract = {A timely and accurate crop yield forecast is crucial to make better decisions on crop management, marketing, and storage by assessing ahead and implementing based on expected crop performance. The objective of this study was to investigate the potential of high-resolution satellite imagery data collected at mid-growing season for identification of within-field variability and to forecast corn yield at different sites within a field. A test was conducted on yield monitor data and RapidEye satellite imagery obtained for 22 cornfields located in five different counties (Clay, Dickinson, Rice, Saline, and Washington) of Kansas (total of 457 ha). Three basic tests were conducted on the data: (1) spatial dependence on each of the yield and vegetation indices (VIs) using Moran's I test; (2) model selection for the relationship between imagery data and actual yield using ordinary least square regression (OLS) and spatial econometric (SPL) models; and (3) model validation for yield forecasting purposes. Spatial autocorrelation analysis (Moran's I test) for both yield and VIs (red edge NDVI = NDVIre, normalized difference vegetation index = NDVIr, SRre = red-edge simple ratio, near infrared = NIR and green-NDVI = NDVIG) was tested positive and statistically significant for most of the fields (p \&lt; 0.05), except for one. Inclusion of spatial adjustment to model improved the model fit on most fields as compared to OLS models, with the spatial adjustment coefficient significant for half of the fields studied. When selected models were used for prediction to validate dataset, a striking similarity (RMSE = 0.02) was obtained between predicted and observed yield within a field. Yield maps could assist implementing more effective site-specific management tools and could be utilized as a proxy of yield monitor data. In summary, high-resolution satellite imagery data can be reasonably used to forecast yield via utilization of models that include spatial adjustment to inform precision agricultural management decisions.},

One set of solutions thus suffices for all methods and provides convenient analytical comparisons. The equations also suggest modifications of the standard techniques so as to duplicate exact solutions for thin atmospheres and thus permit accurate determinations of the effects of typical aerosol layers. Numerical results for the plane albedos of plane-parallel atmospheres (single-scattering albedo = 0.8, 1.0; optical thickness = 0.25, 1, 4. 16; Henyey-Greenstein phase function with asymmetry factor 0.75) are given for conventional and modified Eddington approximations, conventional and modified two-point quadrature schemes, the hemispheric-constant method and the delta-function method, all for comparison with accurate discrete-ordinate solutions. A new two-stream approximation is introduced that reduces to the modified Eddington approximation in the limit of isotropic phase functions and to the exact solution in the limit of extreme anisotropic scattering. Comparisons of plane albedos and transmittances show the new method to be generally superior over a wide range of atmospheric conditions (including cloud and aerosol layers), especially in the case of nonconservative scattering.},

  abstract = {Tropical forest functional diversity, which is a measure of the diversity of organismal interactions with the environment, is poorly understood despite its importance for linking evolutionary biology to ecosystem biogeochemistry. Functional diversity is reflected in functional traits such as the concentrations of different compounds in leaves or the density of leaf mass, which are related to plant activities such as plant defence, nutrient cycling, or growth. In the Amazonian lowlands, river movement and microtopography control nutrient mobility, which may influence functional trait distributions. Here we use airborne laser-guided imaging spectroscopy to develop maps of 16 forest canopy traits, throughout four large landscapes that harbour three common forest community types on the Madre de Dios and Tambopata rivers in southwestern Amazonia. Our maps, which are based on quantitative chemometric analysis of forest canopies with visible-to-near infrared (400\textendash{}2,500 nm) spectroscopy, reveal substantial variation in canopy traits and their distributions within and among forested landscapes. Forest canopy trait distributions are arranged in a nested pattern, with location along rivers controlling trait variation between different landscapes, and microtopography controlling trait variation within landscapes. We suggest that processes of nutrient deposition and depletion drive increasing phosphorus limitation, and a corresponding increase in plant defence, in an eastward direction from the base of the Andes into the Amazon Basin.

  abstract = {Changes in the timing of plant phenology are important indicators of inter-annual climatic variations and are a critical driver of food availability and habitat use for a range of species. A number of remote sensing techniques have recently been developed to observe vegetation cycles throughout the year, including the use of inexpensive visible spectrum digital cameras at the stand level and the use of high temporal frequency Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (AVHRR NOAA) and MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery at a satellite scale. A fundamental challenge with using satellite data to track plant phenology, however, is the trade-off between the level of spatial detail and the revisit time provided by the sensor, and the ability to verify the interpretation of phenological activity. One way to address this challenge is to integrate remotely sensed observations obtained at different spatial and temporal scales to provide information that contains both high temporal density and fine spatial resolution observations. In this article, we compare measures of vegetation phenology observed from a network of ground-based cameras with satellite-derived measures of greenness derived from a fused broad (MODIS) and fine spatial (Landsat) scale satellite data set. We derive and compare three key indicators of phenological activity including the start date of green-up, start date of senescence and length of growing season from both a ground-based camera network and 30 m spatial resolution synthetic Landsat scenes. Results indicate that although field-based estimates, generally, predicted an earlier start and end of the vegetation season than the fused satellite observations, highly significant relationships were found for the prediction of the start (R 2 = 0.65), end (R 2 = 0.72) and length (R 2 = 0.70) of the growing season across all sites. We conclude that some predictable bias exists however unlike visual field measures of the collected data represent both a spectral and a visual archive for later use.},

  abstract = {Increasing size and abundance of lianas relative to trees are pervasive changes in Neotropical forests that may lead to reduced forest carbon stocks. Yet the liana growth form is chronically understudied in large-scale tropical forest censuses, resulting in few data on the scale, cause, and impact of increasing lianas. Satellite and airborne remote sensing provide potential tools to map and monitor lianas at much larger spatial and rapid temporal scales than are possible with plot-based forest censuses. We combined high-resolution airborne imaging spectroscopy and a ground-based tree canopy census to investigate whether tree canopies supporting lianas could be discriminated from tree canopies with no liana coverage. Using support vector machine algorithms, we achieved accuracies of nearly 90\% in discriminating the presence\textendash{}absence of lianas, and low error (15.7\% RMSE) when predicting liana percent canopy cover. When applied to the full image of the study site, our model had a 4.1\% false-positive error rate as validated against an independent plot-level dataset of liana canopy cover. Using the derived liana cover classification map, we show that 6.1\%\textendash{}10.2\% of the 1823 ha study site has high-to-severe (50\textendash{}100\%) liana canopy cover. Given that levels of liana infestation are increasing in Neotropical forests and can result in high tree mortality, the extent of high-to-severe liana canopy cover across the landscape may have broad implications for ecosystem function and forest carbon storage. The ability to accurately map landscape-scale liana infestation is crucial to quantifying their effects on forest function and uncovering the mechanisms underlying their increase.},

  abstract = {Terrestrial biosphere models typically abstract the immense diversity of vegetation forms and functioning into a relatively small set of predefined semi-empirical plant functional types (PFTs). There is growing evidence, however, from the field ecology community as well as from modelling studies that current PFT schemes may not adequately represent the observed variations in plant functional traits and their effect on ecosystem functioning. In this paper, we introduce the Jena Diversity-Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (JeDi-DGVM) as a new approach to terrestrial biosphere modelling with a richer representation of functional diversity than traditional modelling approaches based on a small number of fixed PFTs.  JeDi-DGVM simulates the performance of a large number of randomly generated plant growth strategies, each defined by a set of 15 trait parameters which characterize various aspects of plant functioning including carbon allocation, ecophysiology and phenology. Each trait parameter is involved in one or more functional trade-offs. These trade-offs ultimately determine whether a strategy is able to survive under the climatic conditions in a given model grid cell and its performance relative to the other strategies. The biogeochemical fluxes and land surface properties of the individual strategies are aggregated to the grid-cell scale using a mass-based weighting scheme.  We evaluate the simulated global biogeochemical patterns against a variety of field and satellite-based observations following a protocol established by the Carbon-Land Model Intercomparison Project. The land surface fluxes and vegetation structural properties are reasonably well simulated by JeDi-DGVM, and compare favourably with other state-of-the-art global vegetation models. We also evaluate the simulated patterns of functional diversity and the sensitivity of the JeDi-DGVM modelling approach to the number of sampled strategies. Altogether, the results demonstrate the parsimonious and flexible nature of a functional trade-off approach to global vegetation modelling, i.e. it can provide more types of testable outputs than standard PFT-based approaches and with fewer inputs.  The approach implemented here in JeDi-DGVM sets the foundation for future applications that will explore the impacts of explicitly resolving diverse plant communities, allowing for a more flexible temporal and spatial representation of the structure and function of the terrestrial biosphere.},

A dramatic increase in leaf thickness (2 to 4-fold) under a high growth irradiance (800 $\mu$mol m-2 s-1) compared with a low growth irradiance (60 $\mu$mol m-2 s-1), achieved mainly by expansion of the epidermis, was recorded in both species. The effect took place on the background of modest changes in mesophyll thickness (1.8-fold in T. fluminensis and 1.15-fold in T. sillamontana) and chloroplast size (0.8-fold in T. fluminensis and an insignificant change in T. sillamontana). Mesophyll structure and growth irradiance response did not seem to facilitate significantly light-dependent chloroplast (avoidance) movement in these species. Nevertheless, an exceptionally large (2 to 4-fold) irradiance-induced increase in light transmittance attributable to chloroplast avoidance movement was revealed. This increase by far exceeded that in other higher plants according to available literature. The magnitude of the irradiance-dependent transmittance changes positively correlated both with the rate of photosystem II recovery and with the extent of xanthophyll deepoxidation in the leaves. This was opposite to a negative correlation observed between the same parameters in different plant species. We hypothesize that, at the evolutionary timescale, chloroplast avoidance movement might adjust independently from other photoprotective mechanisms, e.g., non-photochemical quenching, whereas, on the ontogenetic timescale, adjustment of these mechanisms inevitably follows the same trend.},

  abstract = {A geometric-optical forest canopy model that treats conifers as cones casting shadows on a contrasting background can explain the major portion of the variance in a remotely sensed image of a forest stand. The model is driven by interpixel variance generated from three sources: 1) the number of crowns in the pixel; 2) the size of individual crowns; and 3) overlapping of crowns and shadows. The model uses parallel-ray geometry to describe the illumination of a three-dimensional cone and the shadow it casts. Cones are assumed to be randomly placed and may overlap freely. Cone size (height) is distributed lognormally, and cone form, described by the apex angle of the cone, is-fixed in the model but allowed to vary in its application. The model can also be inverted to provide estimates of the size, shape, and spacing of the conifers as cones using remote imagery and a minimum of ground measurements. Field tests using both 10-and 80-m multispectral imagery of two test conifer stands in northeastern California produced reasonable estimates for these parameters. The model appears to be sufficiently general and robust for application to other geometric shapes and mixtures of simple shapes. Thus it has wide potential use not only in remote sensing of vegetation, but also in other remote sensing situations in which discrete objects are imaged at resolutions sufficiently coarje that they canot be resolved individually.},

  abstract = {Functional ecology often analyses a few selected traits and relates them either to environmental conditions or ecosystem properties. However, not the individual trait, but the whole plant with a set of coordinated traits responds to the environment or affects ecosystem properties. Here we argue that the correlation among traits of all major plant organs should be an integral part of response or effect studies. Plants allocate elements and biomass among roots, perennial clonal organs, stems, leaves and seeds to ensure growth and reproduction. Assessment of trait responses to the environment and effects on ecosystems is hardly possible without simultaneously considering all plant organs and the biological functions they perform, namely resource uptake, vegetative regeneration, support and hydraulic pathways, photosynthesis and generative reproduction. Suitable traits to indicate these functions include those of mass, density, size, volume, and element contents of the main plant organs. In principle, we do not propose to collect many traits, but those of similar significance across organs. For instance, specific leaf area should be complemented by specific root length and specific stem length. We present some thoughts on how coordinated allocation to biological functions sets boundaries to the range of trait expressions in successional series and consequently also to species responses to the environment and effects on ecosystems. Considering the coordination of traits amongst all major plant organs will improve our understanding of plant strategies ensuring survival in patterned landscapes.},

  abstract = {In the context of climate change, agricultural managers have the imperative to combine sufficient productivity with durability of the resources. Many studies have shown the interest of recent satellite missions as suitable tools for agricultural surveys. Nevertheless, they are not predictive methods. A system able to detect summer crops as early as possible is important in order to obtain valuable information for a better water management strategy. The detection of summer crops before the beginning of the irrigation period is therefore our objective. The study area is located near Toulouse (southwestern France), and is a region of mixed farming with a wide variety of irrigated and non-irrigated crops. Using the reference data for the years concerned, a set of fixed thresholds are applied to a vegetation index (the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI) for each agricultural season of multi-spectral satellite optical imagery acquired at decametric spatial resolutions from 2006 to 2013. The performance (i.e., accuracy) is contrasted according to the agricultural practices, the development states of the different crops and the number of acquisition dates (one to three in the results presented here). The detection of summer crops reaches 64\% to 88\% with a single date, 80\% to 88\% with two dates and 90\% to 99\% with three dates. The robustness of this method is tested for several years (showing an impact of meteorological conditions on the actual choice of images), several sensors and several resolutions.},

  abstract = {This study develops a simple but physically based canopy radiative transfer scheme for photosynthesis, radiative fluxes and surface albedo estimates in dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs), and particularly for the Ent Dynamic Global Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (Ent DGTEM). The Ent DGTEM can represent vegetation in mixed as opposed to homogeneous canopies. With active growth and competition, it must predict radiative transfer for dynamically changing vegetation structure, and requires computational speed for coupling with atmospheric general circulation models (GCMs). The canopy radiative transfer scheme accounts for both vertical and horizontal heterogeneity of plant canopies by combining the simple two-stream scheme with a well-described actual vertical foliage profile, an analytically derived foliage clumping factor from geometric optical theory, and, for needleleaf trees, an empirical needle-to-shoot-clumping factor. In addition, the model accounts for the effect of trunks, which is significant in bare canopies. This model provides better radiation estimates (light profiles, albedo) than the two-stream scheme currently being used in most GCMs to describe light interactions with vegetation canopies. This scheme has the same computational cost as the current typical scheme being used in GCMs, but promises to provide better canopy radiative transfer estimates for DGVMs, particularly those that model heterogeneous vegetation canopies.},

However, high-resolution mapping of tropical forest canopies is very difficult, because traditional field, airborne, and satellite measurements cannot resolve the number of canopy species, or particular species of interest, over the large regional scales commensurate with conservation goals and strategies. Newer technologies, such as imaging spectroscopy and light detection and ranging (lidar), are just now reaching performance levels that will allow monitoring of tropical forest diversity from the air, but the methods for applying these technologies are not yet ready. Here, we present concepts that combine chemical and spectral remote sensing perspectives to facilitate canopy diversity mapping. Using examples from our ongoing work in the Hawaiian Islands, we demonstrate how a new ``airborne spectranomics'' approach could revolutionize tropical forest monitoring in the future.},

  abstract = {Fine scale maps of vegetation biophysical variables are useful status indicators for monitoring and managing national parks and endangered habitats. Here, we assess in a comparative way four different retrieval methods for estimating leaf area index (LAI) in grassland: two radiative transfer model (RTM) inversion methods (one based on look-up-tables (LUT) and one based on predictive equations) and two statistical modelling methods (one partly, the other entirely based on in situ data). For prediction, spectral data were used that had been acquired over Majella National Park in Italy by the airborne hyperspectral HyMap instrument. To assess the performance of the four investigated models, the normalized root mean squared error (nRMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2) between estimates and in situ LAI measurements are reported (n = 41). Using a jackknife approach, we also quantified the accuracy and robustness of empirical models as a function of the size of the available calibration data set. The results of the study demonstrate that the LUT-based RTM inversion yields higher accuracies for LAI estimation (R2 = 0.91, nRMSE = 0.18) as compared to RTM inversions based on predictive equations (R2 = 0.79, nRMSE = 0.38). The two statistical methods yield accuracies similar to the LUT method. However, as expected, the accuracy and robustness of the statistical models decrease when the size of the calibration database is reduced to fewer samples. The results of this study are of interest for the remote sensing community developing improved inversion schemes for spaceborne hyperspectral sensors applicable to different vegetation types. The examples provided in this paper may also serve as illustrations for the drawbacks and advantages of physical and empirical models.},

To obtain the spectral characteristics of a standardized land area to compare with tower measurements, we scaled up the nominal 500~m MODIS products to a 2.5~km \texttimes{} 2.5~km area (5 \texttimes{} 5 MODIS 500~m grid cells). We then used the scaled-up MODIS products in a coupled canopy-leaf radiative transfer model, PROSAIL-2, to estimate the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) by the part of the canopy dominated by chlorophyll (FAPARchl) versus that by the whole canopy (FAPARcanopy). Using the additional information provided by flux tower-based measurements of gross ecosystem production (GEP) and incident PAR, we determined 90-minute averages for APAR and LUE (slope of GEP:APAR) for both the physiologically active foliage (APARchl, LUEchl) and for the entire canopy (APARcanopy, LUEcanopy).

The flux tower measurements of GEP were strongly related to the MODIS-derived estimates of APARchl (r2 = 0.78) but only weakly related to APARcanopy (r2 = 0.33). Gross LUE between 2001 and 2005 for LUEchl was 0.0241~$\mathrm{\mu}$mol C $\mathrm{\mu}$mol- 1 PPFD whereas LUEcanopy was 36\% lower. Time series of the 5-year normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were used to estimate the average length of the core growing season as days of year 152\textendash{}259. Inter-annual variability in the core growing season LUEchl ($\mathrm{\mu}$mol C $\mathrm{\mu}$mol- 1 PPFD) ranged from 0.0225 in 2003 to 0.0310 in 2004. The five-year time series of LUEchl corresponded well with both the seasonal phase and amplitude of LUE from the tower measurements but this was not the case for LUEcanopy. We conclude that LUEchl derived from MODIS observations could provide a more physiologically realistic parameter than the more commonly used LUEcanopy as an input to large-scale photosynthesis models.},

The radiance calibration was performed with an uncertainty of \textasciitilde{}3\%; the reflectance calibration to an uncertainty of \textasciitilde{}2\%. On-orbit, multiple calibration techniques indicate that the sensor has been stable to better than 0.3\% to date, with the exception of the shortest wavelength band, which has degraded about 1.0\%. A transfer to orbit experiment conducted using the OLI's heliostat-illuminated diffuser suggests that some bands increased in sensitivity on transition to orbit by as much as 5\%, with an uncertainty of \textasciitilde{}2.5\%. On-orbit comparisons to other instruments and vicarious calibration techniques show the radiance (without a~transfer to orbit adjustment), and reflectance calibrations generally agree with other instruments and ground measurements to within the uncertainties.

  abstract = {The European CARBOEUROPE/FLUXNET monitoring sites, spatial remote sensing observations via the EOS-MODIS sensor and ecosystem modelling provide independent and complementary views on the effect of the 2003 heatwave on the European biosphere's productivity and carbon balance. In our analysis, these data streams consistently demonstrate a strong negative anomaly of the primary productivity during the summer of 2003. FLUXNET eddy-covariance data indicate that the drop in productivity was not primarily caused by high temperatures (`heat stress') but rather by limitation of water (drought stress) and that, contrary to the classical expectation about a heat wave, not only gross primary productivity but also ecosystem respiration declined by up to more than to 80~gC~m-2~month-1. Anomalies of carbon and water fluxes were strongly correlated. While there are large between-site differences in water-use efficiency (WUE, 1\textendash{}6~kg~C~kg-1~H2O) here defined as gross carbon uptake divided by evapotranspiration (WUE=GPP/ET), the year-to-year changes in WUE were small ($<$1~g~kg-1) and quite similar for most sites (i.e. WUE decreased during the year of the heatwave). Remote sensing data from MODIS and AVHRR both indicate a strong negative anomaly of the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation in summer 2003, at more than five standard deviations of the previous years. The spatial differentiation of this anomaly follows climatic and land-use patterns: Largest anomalies occur in the centre of the meteorological anomaly (central Western Europe) and in areas dominated by crops or grassland. A preliminary model intercomparison along a gradient from data-oriented models to process-oriented models indicates that all approaches are similarly describing the spatial pattern of ecosystem sensitivity to the climatic 2003 event with major exceptions in the Alps and parts of Eastern Europe, but differed with respect to their interannual variability.},

As a result, the emerging Central-Pacific El Ni{\~n}o produces an overall drying effect on the US winter, particularly over the Ohio\textendash{}Mississippi Valley, Pacific Northwest and Southeast. The enhanced drying effect is related to a more southward displacement of tropospheric jet streams that control the movements of winter storms.

BPS] in the boreal forest of Quebec, Canada. Xylogenesis was studied weekly from April to October for thirteen years (2002\textendash{}2014) on anatomical sections derived by wood microcores. The timing of the growing season detected by remote sensing was extracted from MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250 m 16-days NDVI data. The NDVI time-series were fitted using a double-logistic curve. Phenological chronologies from remote sensing and xylem phenology showed a latitudinal trend. The models correlating the data inferred from satellite sensors and the spring observations of xylem phenology were significant (p \&lt; 0.0001). The length of NDVI growing season and the duration of xylogenesis showed a close correlation. This study demonstrated that the timing of xylem formation could be suitably estimated at wide geographical scale using remote sensing data. However, the inter-annual phenological variability remained unexplained, which might limit the application of the models only to the years considered by our chronologies.},

Considerable research has been directed at the various components of the mapping process, including the assessment of accuracy. This paper briefly reviews the background and methods of classification accuracy assessment that are commonly used and recommended in the research literature. It is, however, evident that the research community does not universally adopt the approaches that are often recommended to it, perhaps a reflection of the problems associated with accuracy assessment, and typically fails to achieve the accuracy targets commonly specified. The community often tends to use, unquestioningly, techniques based on the confusion matrix for which the correct application and interpretation requires the satisfaction of often untenable assumptions (e.g., perfect coregistration of data sets) and the provision of rarely conveyed information (e.g., sampling design for ground data acquisition). Eight broad problem areas that currently limit the ability to appropriately assess, document, and use the accuracy of thematic maps derived from remote sensing are explored. The implications of these problems are that it is unlikely that a single standardized method of accuracy assessment and reporting can be identified, but some possible directions for future research that may facilitate accuracy assessment are highlighted.},

We show that separate lineages of seedlings evolving in identical environments result in many alternative functional designs of approximately equal fitness.},

  abstract = {The assessment of plant water status under drought conditions is essential for the understanding of the adaptation physiological mechanisms of plants, because water stress is one of the most common limitations of crop growth and yield. This study was carried out to estimate the leaf water content in sunflower plants based on spectral reflectance in the near-infrared region. Two varieties of sunflower plants were cultivated during two autumn seasons inside a non-acclimatized greenhouse until the start of the flowering stage, and later were maintained in a growth chamber with the purpose of submitting the plants to a slow and progressive dehydration rate during 12 consecutive days. Measurements of spectral reflectance and leaf mass (fresh and dry) were accomplished along the water stress period. Increases on the spectral reflectance values were observed as the leaf water loss was intensified. The coefficients of determination (R2) of models between leaf water content (LWC) and water index (WI) were 0.948 and 0.956 for Sunbright and Sunbright Supreme varieties, respectively, while the R2 between LWC and wavelength where the first-order derivative of the spectral reflectance is minimum ($\lambda$dmin) were 0.979 and 0.988 for Sunbright and Sunbright Supreme varieties, respectively. Based on the results, the radiometric indicators (WI and $\lambda$dmin) might be useful tools in the development of automatic systems, resulting in a non-destructive, simple, easy, and instantaneous method for monitoring water status in sunflower plants.},

  abstract = {Plant communities are coupled with abiotic factors, as species diversity and community composition both respond to and influence climate and soil characteristics. Interactions between vegetation and abiotic factors depend on plant functional types (PFT) as different growth forms will have differential responses to and effects on site characteristics. However, despite the importance of different PFT for community assembly and ecosystem functioning, research has mainly focused on vascular plants. Here, we established a set of observational plots in two contrasting habitats in northeastern Siberia in order to assess the relationship between species diversity and community composition with soil variables, as well as the relationship between vegetation cover and species diversity for two PFT (nonvascular and vascular). We found that nonvascular species diversity decreased with soil acidity and moisture and, to a lesser extent, with soil temperature and active layer thickness. In contrast, no such correlation was found for vascular species diversity. Differences in community composition were found mainly along soil acidity and moisture gradients. However, the proportion of variation in composition explained by the measured soil variables was much lower for nonvascular than for vascular species when considering the PFT separately. We also found different relationships between vegetation cover and species diversity according the PFT and habitat. In support of niche differentiation theory, species diversity and community composition were related to edaphic factors. The distinct relationships found for nonvascular and vascular species suggest the importance of considering multiple PFT when assessing species diversity and composition and their interaction with edaphic factors. Synthesis: Identifying vegetation responses to edaphic factors is a first step toward a better understanding of vegetation\textendash{}soil feedbacks under climate change. Our results suggest that incorporating differential responses of PFT is important for predicting vegetation shifts, primary productivity, and in turn, ecosystem functioning in a changing climate.},

  abstract = {Extraction of vegetation information from remotely sensed images has remained a long-term challenge due to the influence of soil background. To reduce this effect, the slope and intercept of the soil line (SL) should be known to calculate SL-related vegetation indices (VIs). These VIs can be used to estimate the biophysical parameters of agricultural crops. However, it is a difficult task to retrieve the SL parameters under the vegetation canopy. A feasible method for retrieving these parameters involves extracting the bottom boundary line in two-dimensional spectral spaces (i.e., red and near-infrared bands). In this study, the slope and intercept of the SL was extracted from Landsat 8 OLI images of a test site in northeastern Germany. Different statistical methods, including the Red-NIRmin method, quantile regression method (using a floating tau with the smallest p-value), and a new approach proposed in this paper using a fixed quantile tau known as the diffuse non-interceptance (DIFN) value, were applied to retrieve the SL parameters. The DIFN value describes the amount of light visible below the canopy that reaches the soil surface. Therefore, this value can be used as a threshold for retrieving the bottom soil line. The simulated SLs were compared with actual ones extracted from ground truth data, as recorded by a handheld spectrometer, and were also compared with the SL retrieved from bare soil pixels of the Landsat 8 image collected after harvest. Subsequently, the SL parameters were used to separately estimate the dry biomasses of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), and canola (Brassica napus L.) at the local and field scales using different SL-related vegetation indices. The SL can be retrieved more accurately at the local scale compared with the field scale, and its simulation can be critical in the field due to significant differences from the actual SL. Moreover, the slope and intercept of the simulated SLs found using the floating and fixed quantile tau (slope $\approx$ 1.1 and intercept $\approx$ 0.05) show better agreement with the actual SL parameters (slope $\approx$ 1.2 and intercept $\approx$ 0.03) in the late growing stages (i.e., end of ripening and senescence stages) of crops. The slope and intercept of the soil line extracted from bare soil pixels of the Landsat 8 OLI data after harvest (slope = 1.3, intercept = 0.03, and R2 = 0.94) are similar to those of the simulated SL. The correlation coefficient (R2) of the simulated SLs are greater than 0.97 during different growing stage and all of the SL parameters are statistically significant (p \&lt; 0.05) at the local scale. The results also imply the need for different vegetation indices to best retrieve the crop biomass depending on the growing stage, but relatively small differences in performances were observed in this study.},

  abstract = {For mapping, quantifying and monitoring regional and global forest health, satellite remote sensing provides fundamental data for the observation of spatial and temporal forest patterns and processes. While new remote-sensing technologies are able to detect forest data in high quality and large quantity, operational applications are still limited by deficits of in situ verification. In situ sampling data as input is required in order to add value to physical imaging remote sensing observations and possibilities to interlink the forest health assessment with biotic and abiotic factors. Numerous methods on how to link remote sensing and in situ data have been presented in the scientific literature using e.g. empirical and physical-based models. In situ data differs in type, quality and quantity between case studies. The irregular subsets of in situ data availability limit the exploitation of available satellite remote sensing data. To achieve a broad implementation of satellite remote sensing data in forest monitoring and management, a standardization of in situ data, workflows and products is essential and necessary for user acceptance. The key focus of the review is a discussion of concept and is designed to bridge gaps of understanding between forestry and remote sensing science community. Methodological approaches for in situ/remote-sensing implementation are organized and evaluated with respect to qualifying for forest monitoring. Research gaps and recommendations for standardization of remote-sensing based products are discussed. Concluding the importance of outstanding organizational work to provide a legally accepted framework for new information products in forestry are highlighted.},

Here we test the applicability of remote sensing, particularly novel use of waveform lidar measurements, for quantifying the habitat heterogeneity of a contiguous northern hardwoods forest in the northeastern United States. We apply these results to predict the breeding habitat quality, an indicator of reproductive output of a well-studied Neotropical migrant songbird, the Black-throated Blue Warbler (Dendroica caerulescens). We found that using canopy vertical structure metrics provided unique information for models of habitat quality and spatial patterns of prevalence. An ensemble decision tree modeling approach (random forests) consistently identified lidar metrics describing the vertical distribution and complexity of canopy elements as important predictors of habitat use over multiple years. Although other aspects of habitat were important, including the seasonality of vegetation cover, the canopy structure variables provided unique and complementary information that systematically improved model predictions. We conclude that canopy structure metrics derived from waveform lidar, which will be available on future satellite missions, can advance multiple aspects of biodiversity research, and additional studies should be extended to other organisms and regions.},

  abstract = {Functional diversity is critical for ecosystem dynamics, stability and productivity. However, dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) which are increasingly used to simulate ecosystem functions under global change, condense functional diversity to plant functional types (PFTs) with constant parameters. Here, we develop an individual- and trait-based version of the DGVM LPJmL (Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed Land) called LPJmL- flexible individual traits (LPJmL-FIT) with flexible individual traits) which we apply to generate plant trait maps for the Amazon basin. LPJmL-FIT incorporates empirical ranges of five traits of tropical trees extracted from the TRY global plant trait database, namely specific leaf area (SLA), leaf longevity (LL), leaf nitrogen content (Narea), the maximum carboxylation rate of Rubisco per leaf area (vcmaxarea), and wood density (WD). To scale the individual growth performance of trees, the leaf traits are linked by trade-offs based on the leaf economics spectrum, whereas wood density is linked to tree mortality. No preselection of growth strategies is taking place, because individuals with unique trait combinations are uniformly distributed at tree establishment. We validate the modeled trait distributions by empirical trait data and the modeled biomass by a remote sensing product along a climatic gradient. Including trait variability and trade-offs successfully predicts natural trait distributions and achieves a more realistic representation of functional diversity at the local to regional scale. As sites of high climatic variability, the fringes of the Amazon promote trait divergence and the coexistence of multiple tree growth strategies, while lower plant trait diversity is found in the species-rich center of the region with relatively low climatic variability. LPJmL-FIT enables to test hypotheses on the effects of functional biodiversity on ecosystem functioning and to apply the DGVM to current challenges in ecosystem management from local to global scales, that is, deforestation and climate change effects.},

  abstract = {The Radiation Transfer Model Intercomparison (RAMI) initiative benchmarks canopy reflectance models under well-controlled experimental conditions. Launched for the first time in 1999, this triennial community exercise encourages the systematic evaluation of canopy reflectance models on a voluntary basis. The first phase of RAMI focused on documenting the spread among radiative transfer (RT) simulations over a small set of primarily 1-D canopies. The second phase expanded the scope to include structurally complex 3-D plant architectures with and without background topography. Here sometimes significant discrepancies were noted which effectively prevented the definition of a reliable ``surrogate truth,'' over heterogeneous vegetation canopies, against which other RT models could then be compared. The present paper documents the outcome of the third phase of RAMI, highlighting both the significant progress that has been made in terms of model agreement since RAMI-2 and the capability of/need for RT models to accurately reproduce local estimates of radiative quantities under conditions that are reminiscent of in situ measurements. Our assessment of the self-consistency and the relative and absolute performance of 3-D Monte Carlo models in RAMI-3 supports their usage in the generation of a ``surrogate truth'' for all RAMI test cases. This development then leads (1) to the presentation of the ``RAMI Online Model Checker'' (ROMC), an open-access web-based interface to evaluate RT models automatically, and (2) to a reassessment of the role, scope, and opportunities of the RAMI project in the future.},

Ignoring nutrient limitations, large increases in carbon sequestration from carbon dioxide (CO2) fertilization are expected in these forests. Yet, forests are usually relegated to sites of moderate to poor fertility, where tree growth is often limited by nutrient supply, in particular nitrogen. Here we present evidence that estimates of increases in carbon sequestration of forests, which is expected to partially compensate for increasing CO2 in the atmosphere, are unduly optimistic. In two forest experiments on maturing pines exposed to elevated atmospheric CO2, the CO2-induced biomass carbon increment without added nutrients was undetectable at a nutritionally poor site, and the stimulation at a nutritionally moderate site was transient, stabilizing at a marginal gain after three years. However, a large synergistic gain from higher CO2 and nutrients was detected with nutrients added. This gain was even larger at the poor site (threefold higher than the expected additive effect) than at the moderate site (twofold higher). Thus, fertility can restrain the response of wood carbon sequestration to increased atmospheric CO2. Assessment of future carbon sequestration should consider the limitations imposed by soil fertility, as well as interactions with nitrogen deposition.},

  abstract = {* Spectroscopy has recently emerged as an effective method to accurately characterize leaf biochemistry in living tissue through the application of chemometric approaches to foliar optical data, but this approach has not been widely used for plant secondary metabolites. Here, we examine the ability of reflectance spectroscopy to quantify specific phenolic compounds in trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) and paper birch (Betula papyrifera) that play influential roles in ecosystem functioning related to trophic-level interactions and nutrient cycling.

* Spectral measurements on live aspen and birch leaves were collected, after which concentrations of condensed tannins (aspen and birch) and salicinoids (aspen only) were determined using standard analytical approaches in the laboratory. Predictive models were then constructed using jackknifed, partial least squares regression (PLSR). Model performance was evaluated using coefficient of determination (R2), root-mean-square error (RMSE) and the per cent RMSE of the data range (\%RMSE).

* Condensed tannins of aspen and birch were well predicted from both combined (R2~=~0$\cdot$86, RMSE~=~2$\cdot$4, \%RMSE~=~7\%)- and individual-species models (aspen: R2~=~0$\cdot$86, RMSE~=~2$\cdot$4, \%RMSE~=~6\%; birch: R2~=~0$\cdot$81, RMSE~=~1$\cdot$9, \%RMSE~=~10\%). Aspen total salicinoids were better predicted than individual salicinoids (total: R2~=~0$\cdot$76, RMSE~=~2$\cdot$4, \%RMSE~=~8\%; salicortin: R2~=~0$\cdot$57, RMSE~=~1$\cdot$9, \%RMSE~=~11\%; tremulacin: R2~=~0$\cdot$72, RMSE~=~1$\cdot$1, \%RMSE~=~11\%), and spectra collected from dry leaves produced better models for both aspen tannins (R2~=~0$\cdot$92, RMSE~=~1$\cdot$7, \%RMSE~=~5\%) and salicinoids (R2~=~0$\cdot$84, RMSE~=~1$\cdot$4, \%RMSE~=~5\%) compared with spectra from fresh leaves. The decline in prediction performance from total to individual salicinoids and from dry to fresh measurements was marginal, however, given the increase in detailed salicinoid information acquired and the time saved by avoiding drying and grinding leaf samples.

* Reflectance spectroscopy can successfully characterize specific secondary metabolites in living plant tissue and provide detailed information on individual compounds within a constituent group. The ability to simultaneously measure multiple plant traits is a powerful attribute of reflectance spectroscopy because of its potential for in~situ\textendash{}in~vivo field deployment using portable spectrometers. The suite of traits currently estimable, however, needs to expand to include specific secondary metabolites that play influential roles in ecosystem functioning if we are to advance the integration of chemical, landscape and ecosystem ecology.},

Traditionally this has been accomplished using categorical representations such as plant functional types. Increasingly, plant functional ecologists have sought to refine categorical functional types via quantitative functional traits in order to understand the ecological implications of trade-offs in plant form and function. Fewer works have focused upon testing whether commonly measured functional traits enhance our understanding of plant biogeography broadly and the geographic distribution of vegetation types in particular. Here we combine a continental-scale forest inventory data set containing 18$\mkern1mu$111 plots with a plant functional trait data set to ask: (1) Is there a strong relationship between the abiotic environment and the distribution of functional trait values in forest inventory plots? And (2) can different Holdridge life zones be distinguished upon the basis of their functional trait distributions? The results show geographic patterns of functional trait distributions that are often strongly correlated with climate and also show that the Holdridge life zones in the study area can be differentiated using a combination of functional traits.},

  abstract = {There is growing recognition of the role of mechanistic scaling laws in shaping ecological pattern and process. While such theoretical relationships explain much of the variation across large scales, at any particular scale there is important residual variation that is left unexplained among species, among individuals within a species, and within individuals themselves. Key questions remain on what explains this variability and how we can apply this information in practice, in particular to produce estimates in high-diversity systems with many rare and under-sampled species. We apply hierarchical Bayes statistical techniques to data on crown geometry from diverse temperate forests in order to simultaneously model the differences within and among species. We find that tree height, canopy depth, and canopy radius are affected by both successional stage and wood mechanical strength, while tree height conforms to the predicted 2/3 power relationship. Furthermore, we show that hierarchical modeling allows us to constrain the allometries of rare species much more than traditional methods. Finally, crown radius was shown to vary substantially more within individuals than among individuals or species, suggesting that the capacity for local light foraging and crown plasticity exerts the dominant control on tree crowns.},

  abstract = {Great uncertainty exists in the global exchange of carbon between the atmosphere and the terrestrial biosphere. An important source of this uncertainty lies in the dependency of photosynthesis on the maximum rate of carboxylation (Vcmax) and the maximum rate of electron transport (Jmax). Understanding and making accurate prediction of C fluxes thus requires accurate characterization of these rates and their relationship with plant nutrient status over large geographic scales. Plant nutrient status is indicated by the traits: leaf nitrogen (N), leaf phosphorus (P), and specific leaf area (SLA). Correlations between Vcmax and Jmax and leaf nitrogen (N) are typically derived from local to global scales, while correlations with leaf phosphorus (P) and specific leaf area (SLA) have typically been derived at a local scale. Thus, there is no global-scale relationship between Vcmax and Jmax and P or SLA limiting the ability of global-scale carbon flux models do not account for P or SLA. We gathered published data from 24 studies to reveal global relationships of Vcmax and Jmax with leaf N, P, and SLA. Vcmax was strongly related to leaf N, and increasing leaf P substantially increased the sensitivity of Vcmax to leaf N. Jmax was strongly related to Vcmax, and neither leaf N, P, or SLA had a substantial impact on the relationship. Although more data are needed to expand the applicability of the relationship, we show leaf P is a globally important determinant of photosynthetic rates. In a model of photosynthesis, we showed that at high leaf N (3~gm-2), increasing leaf P from 0.05 to 0.22~gm-2 nearly doubled assimilation rates. Finally, we show that plants may employ a conservative strategy of Jmax to Vcmax coordination that restricts photoinhibition when carboxylation is limiting at the expense of maximizing photosynthetic rates when light is limiting.},

  abstract = {Plant traits can mediate the strength of interactions between omnivorous predators and their prey through density effects and changes in the omnivores' trophic behavior. In this study, we explored the established assumption that enhanced nutrient status in host plants strengthens the buffering effect of plant feeding for omnivorous predators, i.e., prevents rapid negative population growth during prey density decline and thereby increases and stabilizes omnivore population density. We analyzed 13 years of field data on population densities of a heteropteran omnivore on Salix cinerea stands, arranged along a measured leaf nitrogen gradient and found a 195 \% increase in omnivore population density and a 63 \% decrease in population variability with an increase in leaf nitrogen status from 26 to 40 mgN \texttimes{} g-1. We recreated the leaf nitrogen gradient in a greenhouse experiment and found, as expected, that increasing leaf nitrogen status enhanced omnivore performance but reduced per capita prey consumption. Feeding on high nitrogen status host plants can potentially decouple omnivore\textendash{}prey population dynamics and allow omnivores to persist and function effectively at low prey densities to provide ``background level'' control of insect herbivores. This long-term effect is expected to outweigh the short-term effect on per capita prey consumption\textemdash{}resulting in a net increase in population predation rates with increasing leaf nitrogen status. Conservation biological control of insect pests that makes use of omnivore background control could, as a result, be manipulated via management of crop nitrogen status.},

  abstract = {Forests provide an array of services ranging from forest products to greenhouse gas absorption. The reliability and appropriateness of management decisions concerning ecosystem services and resources are directly correlated with the accuracy and extent of the available information on forests and related dynamics. Historically, forest resource management activities informed by decision support systems, have largely relied on field measurements, often with sparse geographical, temporal, and ecological coverage. In contrast, remotely-sensed data can provide dense temporal coverage over large areas. Landsat data in particular have spatial and temporal characteristics well-suited to capturing forest changes on the landscape. Since 2008 free and open access to analysis-ready data representing more than 40 years of data in the Landsat archive has created new opportunities for forest monitoring. There is however, a need to link forest information generated from remotely-sensed data to the data input needs of decision support systems. Here, we develop such a linkage between field and remotely-sensed observations to characterize one of the main drivers of forest change: growth. The goal of this research is to produce above-ground biomass (AGB) change estimates that integrate the information of re-measured field plots and that of the Landsat time series. Over a large test area ($\sim$3.3 Mha) in Saskatchewan, Canada, we demonstrate how information from a dense Landsat time series (1984\textendash{}2012) can be used with a network of field plots to estimate change in AGB over the broad geographical, temporal, and ecological range of these forests. Our approach expands forest growth estimation both spatially and temporally, and results in information layers that are directly ingestible in decision support models. Our results show that trends match between the field plots and the remote-sensing-field-combined estimate, but that the more encompassing spatial estimates give more varied and lower average estimates of AGB change for our study region. We hypothesize that integrating both remotely-sensed information and repeated field measurements covers a wider range of ecological conditions, forest productivity, and forest developmental stages present on the landscape and through time than the field plots alone. The next step in our research is to integrate our findings into the forest resource management decision support tools, with the aim of increasingly spatializing what are usually spatially-referenced models. Our findings highlight emergent synergies between complementary data sources that foster the generation of new information products for forest resources management decision support.},

  abstract = {We tested the ability of a model to scale gas exchange from leaf level to whole-tree level by: (1) measuring leaf gas exchange in the canopy of 10 trees in a tall Eucalyptus delegatensis RT Baker forest in NSW, Australia; (2) monitoring sap flow of the same 10 trees during the measurement week; and (3) using an individual-tree-based model (MAESTRA) to link the two sets of measurements. Photosynthesis and stomatal conductance components of the model were parameterized with the leaf gas exchange data, and canopy structure was parameterized with crown heights, dimensions and leaf areas of each of the measurement trees and up to 45 neighboring trees. Transpiration of the measurement trees was predicted by the model and compared with sap flow data. Leaf gas exchange parameters were similar for all 10 trees, with the exception of two smaller trees that had relatively low stomatal conductances. We hypothesize that these trees may have experienced water stress as a result of competition from large neighboring trees.
The model performed well, and in most cases, was able to replicate the time course of tree transpiration. Maximum rates of transpiration were higher than measured rates for some trees and lower than measured rates for others, which may have been a result of inaccuracy in estimating tree leaf area. There was a small lag (about 15\textendash{}30 minutes) between sap flow and modeled transpiration for some trees in the morning, likely associated with use of water stored in stems. The model also captured patterns of variation in sap flow among trees. Overall, the study confirms the ability of models to estimate forest canopy transpiration from leaf-level measurements.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing has proven a useful way of evaluating long-term trends in vegetation ``greenness'' through the use of vegetation indices like Normalized Differences Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). In particular, analyses of greenness trends have been performed for large areas (continents, for example) in an attempt to understand vegetation response to climate. These studies have been most often used coarse resolution sensors like Moderate Resolution Image Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). However, trends in greenness are also important at more local scales, particularly in and around cities as vegetation offers a variety of valuable ecosystem services ranging from minimizing air pollution to mitigating urban heat island effects. To explore the ability to monitor greenness trends in and around cities, this paper presents a new way for analyzing greenness trends based on all available Landsat 5, 7, and 8 images and applies it to Guangzhou, China. This method is capable of including the effects of land cover change in the evaluation of greenness trends by separating the effects of abrupt and gradual changes, and providing information on the timing of greenness trends.

An assessment of the consistency of surface reflectance from Landsat 8 with past Landsat sensors indicates biases in the visible bands of Landsat 8, especially the blue band. Landsat 8 NDVI values were found to have a larger bias than the EVI values; therefore, EVI was used in the analysis of greenness trends for Guangzhou. In spite of massive amounts of development in Guangzhou from 2000 to 2014, greenness was found to increase, mostly as a result of gradual change. Comparison of the greening magnitudes estimated from the approach presented here and a Simple Linear Trend (SLT) method indicated large differences for certain time intervals as the SLT method does not include consideration for abrupt land cover changes. Overall, this analysis demonstrates the importance of considering land cover change when analyzing trends in greenness from satellite time series in areas where land cover change is common.},

  abstract = {We show in climate model experiments that large-scale afforestation in northern mid-latitudes warms the Northern Hemisphere and alters global circulation patterns. An expansion of dark forests increases the absorption of solar energy and increases surface temperature, particularly in regions where the land surface is unable to compensate with latent heat flux due to water limitation. Atmospheric circulation redistributes the anomalous energy absorbed in the northern hemisphere, in particular toward the south, through altering the Hadley circulation, resulting in the northward displacement of the tropical rain bands. Precipitation decreases over parts of the Amazon basin affecting productivity and increases over the Sahel and Sahara regions in Africa. We find that the response of climate to afforestation in mid-latitudes is determined by the amount of soil moisture available to plants with the greatest warming found in water-limited regions. Mid-latitude afforestation is found to have a small impact on modeled global temperatures and on global CO2, but regional heating from the increase in forest cover is capable of driving unintended changes in circulation and precipitation. The ability of vegetation to affect remote circulation has implications for strategies for climate mitigation.},

  abstract = {Patterns of tropical forest functional diversity express processes of ecological assembly at multiple geographic scales and aid in predicting ecological responses to environmental change. Tree canopy chemistry underpins forest functional diversity, but the interactive role of phylogeny and environment in determining the chemical traits of tropical trees is poorly known. Collecting and analyzing foliage in 2,420 canopy tree species across 19 forests in the western Amazon, we discovered (i) systematic, community-scale shifts in average canopy chemical traits along gradients of elevation and soil fertility; (ii) strong phylogenetic partitioning of structural and defense chemicals within communities independent of variation in environmental conditions; and (iii) strong environmental control on foliar phosphorus and calcium, the two rock-derived elements limiting CO2 uptake in tropical forests. These findings indicate that the chemical diversity of western Amazonian forests occurs in a regionally nested mosaic driven by long-term chemical trait adjustment of communities to large-scale environmental filters, particularly soils and climate, and is supported by phylogenetic divergence of traits essential to foliar survival under varying environmental conditions. Geographically nested patterns of forest canopy chemical traits will play a role in determining the response and functional rearrangement of western Amazonian ecosystems to changing land use and climate.},

We investigated the relation between morphological traits of leaf surfaces and tree ecological characteristics in a Malaysian tropical rain forest. The shapes and densities of stomata and trichomes on the abaxial leaf surfaces and their relation with leaf characteristics such as leaf area and leaf mass per area (LMA) were studied in 136 tree species in 35 families with different growth forms in the tropical moist forest. Leaf physiological properties were also measured in 50 canopy and emergent species. Most tree species had flat type (40.4 \%) or mound type (39.7 \%) stomata. In addition, 84 species (61.76 \%) in 22 families had trichomes, including those with glandular (17.65 \%) and non-glandular trichomes (44.11 \%). Most leaf characteristics significantly varied among the growth form types: species in canopy and emergent layers and canopy gap conditions had higher stomatal density, stomatal pore index (SPI), trichome density and LMA than species in understory and subcanopy layers, though the relation of phylogenetically independent contrasts to each characteristic was not statistically significant, except for leaf stomatal density, SPI and LMA. Intrinsic water use efficiency in canopy and emergent tree species with higher trichome densities was greater than in species with lower trichome densities. These results suggest that tree species in tropical rain forests adapt to a spatial difference in their growth forms, which are considerably affected by phylogenetic context, by having different stomatal and trichome shapes and/or densities.},

  abstract = {Questions

Can forest structure significantly predict tree species diversity in the forests of the North Carolina Piedmont? If so, which structural attributes are most correlated with it, and how effective are they when used in concert in a generalized predictive model of tree species diversity?

Location

North Carolina Piedmont, USA.

Methods

Using a set of geographically distributed Forest inventory and analysis (FIA) plots (n~=~972), we analysed Spearman correlations between 15 measures of forest structure and five indices of tree species diversity. We predict tree species diversity based on structural predictors using support vector regression (SVR) models, assessing model fit via ten-fold cross-validation.

Results

Results show a consistent and significant relationship between most structural attributes and indices of tree species diversity. Among all structural predictors, maximum height, basal area size inequality (basal area Gini coefficient) and skewness of the basal area distribution (Weibull shape) exhibited the strongest correlations with indices of tree species diversity. Predictive SVR models trained solely with structural attributes explained 44\textendash{}61\% of the variance in tree species diversity in the full Piedmont data set, and 22\textendash{}71\% of the variance in subsets defined by stand origin and forest type.

Conclusions

Results confirm that forest structure alone was able to predict a substantial portion of the variance in tree species diversity without accounting for other known predictors of diversity in the North Carolina Piedmont, such as environment, soil conditions and site history. Beyond the theoretical implications of unravelling primary patterns underlying tree species diversity, these findings highlight the empirical basis and potential for utilizing forest structure in predictive models of tree species diversity over large geographic regions.},

It covers the VNIR/SWIR spectral region in 13 bands and incorporates two new spectral bands in the red-edge region, which can be used to derive vegetation indices using red-edge bands in their formulation. These are particularly suitable for estimating canopy chlorophyll and nitrogen (N) content. This band setting is important for vegetation studies and is very similar to the ones of the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) on the planned Sentinel-3 satellite and the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) on Envisat, which operated from 2002 to early 2012. This paper focuses on the potential of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 in estimating total crop and grass chlorophyll and N content by studying in situ crop variables and spectroradiometer measurements obtained for four different test sites. In particular, the red-edge chlorophyll index (CIred-edge), the green chlorophyll index (CIgreen) and the MERIS terrestrial chlorophyll index (MTCI) were found to be accurate and linear estimators of canopy chlorophyll and N content and the Sentinel-2 and -3 bands are well positioned for deriving these indices. Results confirm the importance of the red-edge bands on particularly Sentinel-2 for agricultural applications, because of the combination with its high spatial resolution of 20 m.},

  abstract = {Our aim was to assess whether plant trait values and functional types are associated with environmental features in floodplain wetlands. The study was conducted in the Lower Paran{\'a} River floodplain, mostly dominated by marsh communities. In 72 sites, 16 functional traits were screened for 95 plant populations of 44 species. Since the interspecific variability in trait values resulted higher than the intraspecific variability, plant species (and not populations) were hierarchically classified into plant functional types (PFTs). Ten PFTs were identified. Two trade-offs were observed: resource acquisition vs. resource conservation or resource assignment to tissues conferring anoxia or salinity tolerance, and fast growth vs. light interception. Cover-abundance of the PFTs and community-level weighted means (CWMs) of the non-redundant traits were computed for 80 sites. Generalized linear models were used to assess the effect of environmental variables (landscape units, topographic positions, flooding frequency and eight soil variables) on the CWMs and on distribution of PFTs occurring in 15 sites or more. A two-stage modelling process was carried out to account for the presence\textendash{}absence and cover\textendash{}abundance of PFTs separately. The association between CWMs and environmental features was relatively weak but significant for six out of the eight traits analysed. Besides, satisfactory models were found for eight out of the nine PFTs assessed. In the studied floodplain, PFTs\textendash{}interpreted in terms of life strategies\textendash{}seem to be a better approach than CWMs to understand and characterise functional responses to the environment.},

Five healthy Haloxylon ammodendron trees were randomly selected to monitor the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) and its relation to light use efficiency (LUE) in shaded and sunlit assimilating branches. Linear regression was performed where the results revealed that LUE decreased with seasonal courses with vivid midday depression regardless of light variation within canopies. PRI and LUE decoupled in early spring when the foliage was deeply downregulated, with high correlation (R2=0.8, p$<$0.001) during most parts of the year. Measured and estimated LUE were highly correlated for the July to September dataset (R2=0.73, p$<$0.001) compared to May to June datasets (R2=0.35, p$<$0.001). The estimated LUE for young assimilating branches could be obtained with a high RMSE of 0.01, compared to mature branches with an RMSE of 0.003. The measured LUE values were $\sim$20\% higher than estimated LUE during the period from May to June, and values were slightly lower at the end of the growing season. This was attributed to differences in the physiological and biochemical mechanisms controlling the seasonal dynamics of PRI. Therefore, PRI is the best estimator of LUE when age-related changes and canopy light partitioning are considered in assimilating organs. Combined use of PRI with pigments could improve the remote evaluation of LUE.},

  abstract = {The forest canopy is the medium for energy, mass, and momentum exchanges between the forest ecosystem and the atmosphere. Tree crown size is a critical aspect of canopy structure that significantly influences these biophysical processes in the canopy. Tree crown size is also strongly related to other canopy structural parameters, such as tree height, diameter at breast height and biomass. But information about tree crown sizes is difficult to obtain and rarely available from traditional forest inventory. The study objective was to test the hypothesis that a model previously developed for estimation of tree crown size can be generalized across sensors and sites. Our study sites include the Racoon Ecological Management Area in southeast Ohio, USA and the Duke Forest in North Carolina Piedmont, USA. We sampled a series of circular plots in the summers of 2005 and 2007. We derived average tree crown diameter (CD) for trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) greater than 6.4 cm (2.5 in) for each sampling plot. We developed statistical models using image spatial information from Ikonos and QuickBird images as the independent variable and CD for stands in Ohio as the dependent variable. The models provide an explanation of tree crown size for the hardwood stands comparable to other approaches (R2 = $\sim$ 0.5 and RMSE = 0.83 m). Moreover, the models that estimate tree crown size using the ratio of image variances at two spatial resolutions can be applied across sensors and sites, i.e. the statistical models developed with Ikonos images can be applied directly to estimate tree crown size with QuickBird image, and the statistical models developed in Ohio can be applied directly to estimate tree crown size with images in North Carolina. These results indicate that the model developed based on image variance ratio at two spatial resolutions can be used to take advantage of existing sampling plot data and images to estimate CD with more recent images, enhancing the efficiency of forest resources inventory and monitoring.},

  abstract = {Until recently, advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR) observations were the only viable source of data for global land cover mapping. While many useful insights have been gained from analyses based on AVHRR data, the availability of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data with greatly improved spectral, spatial, geometric, and radiometric attributes provides significant new opportunities and challenges for remote sensing-based land cover mapping research. In this paper, we describe the algorithms and databases being used to produce the MODIS global land cover product. This product provides maps of global land cover at 1-km spatial resolution using several classification systems, principally that of the IGBP. To generate these maps, a supervised classification methodology is used that exploits a global database of training sites interpreted from high-resolution imagery in association with ancillary data. In addition to the IGBP class at each pixel, the MODIS land cover product provides several other parameters including estimates for the classification confidence associated with the IGBP label, a prediction for the most likely alternative class, and class labels for several other classification schemes that are used by the global modeling community. Initial results based on 5 months of MODIS data are encouraging. At global scales, the distribution of vegetation and land cover types is qualitatively realistic. At regional scales, comparisons among heritage AVHRR products, Landsat TM data, and results from MODIS show that the algorithm is performing well. As a longer time series of data is added to the processing stream and the representation of global land cover in the site database is refined, the quality of the MODIS land cover product will improve accordingly.},

  abstract = {Sensors on Landsat satellites have been collecting images of the Earth's surface for nearly 40 years. These images have been invaluable for characterizing and detecting changes in the land cover and land use of the world. Although initially conceived as primarily picture generating sensors, even the early sensors were radiometrically calibrated and spectrally characterized prior to launch and incorporated some capabilities to monitor their radiometric calibration once on orbit. Recently, as the focus of studies has shifted to monitoring Earth surface parameters over significant periods of time, serious attention has been focused toward bringing the data from all these sensors onto a common radiometric scale over this 40-year period. This effort started with the most recent systems and then was extended back in time. Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM)+, the best-characterized sensor of the series prior to launch and once on orbit, and the most stable system to date, was chosen to serve as the reference. The Landsat-7 project was the first of the series to build an image assessment system into its ground system, allowing systematic characterization of its sensors and data. Second, the Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) (still operating at the time of the Landsat-7 launch and continues to operate) calibration history was reconstructed based on its internal calibrator, vicarious calibrations, pseudo-invariant sites and a tie to Landsat-7 ETM + at the time of the commissioning of Landsat-7. This process was performed in two iterations: the earlier one relied primarily on the TM internal calibrator. When this was found to have some deficiencies, a revised calibration was based more on pseudo-invariant sites, though the internal calibrator was still used to establish the short-term variations in response due to contaminant build up on the cold focal plane. As time progressed, a capability to monitor the Landsat-5 TM was added to the image assessment system. The Landsat-4 TM, which operated from 1982 to 1992, was the third system to which the radiometric scale was extended. The limited and broken use of the Landsat-4 TM made this analysis more difficult. Eight-day separated image pairs from Landsat-5 combined with analysis of pseudo invariant sites established this history. The fourth and most challenging effort was making the Landsat 1\textendash{}5 Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS) sensors' data internally radiometrically consistent. This effort was particularly complicated by the age of the MSS data, varying formats and processing levels in the archive, limited datasets, and limited documentation available. Ultimately, pseudo-invariant sites were identified in North America and used for this effort. Note that most of the Landsat MSS archived data had already been calibrated using the MSS internal calibrators, so this processing was embedded in the result. The final effort was developing an absolute scale for Landsat MSS similar to what was already established for the ``TM'' sensors. This was accomplished by using simultaneous data from Landsat-5 MSS and Landsat-5 TM, accounting for spectral differences between the sensors using EO-1 Hyperion data. The recalibrated history of the Landsat data and implications to users are discussed. The key result from this work is a consistently calibrated Landsat data archive that spans nearly 40 years with total uncertainties on the order of 10\% or less for most sensors and bands.},

Over the last decade, the NDVI has proven extremely useful in predicting herbivore and non-herbivore distribution, abundance and life history traits in space and time. Due to the continuous nature of NDVI since mid-1981, the relative importance of different temporal and spatial lags on population performance can be assessed, widening our understanding of population dynamics. Previously thought to be most useful in temperate environments, the utility of this satellite-derived index has been demonstrated even in sparsely vegetated areas. Climate models can be used to reconstruct historical patterns in vegetation dynamics in addition to anticipating the effects of future environmental change on biodiversity. NDVI has thus been established as a crucial tool for assessing past and future population and biodiversity consequences of change in climate, vegetation phenology and primary productivity.},

On the basis of 13C-determined fluxes from nine bacteria and multi-objective optimization theory, we show that metabolism operates close to the Pareto-optimal surface of a three-dimensional space defined by competing objectives. Consistent with flux data from evolved Escherichia coli, we propose that flux states evolve under the trade-off between two principles: optimality under one given condition and minimal adjustment between conditions. These principles form the forces by which evolution shapes metabolic fluxes in microorganisms' environmental context.
A key design principle of bacterial metabolic networks is optimal performance, but not at the expense of adaptability.

  abstract = {Whereas warming enhances plant nutrient status and photosynthesis in most terrestrial ecosystems, dryland vegetation is vulnerable to the likely increases in evapotranspiration and reductions in soil moisture caused by elevated temperatures. Any warming-induced declines in plant primary production and cover in drylands would increase erosion, land degradation, and desertification. We conducted a four-year manipulative experiment in a semi-arid Mediterranean ecosystem to evaluate the impacts of a \textasciitilde{}2$^\circ$C warming on the photosynthesis, transpiration, leaf nutrient status, chlorophyll content, isotopic composition, biomass growth, and postsummer survival of the native shrub Helianthemum squamatum. We predicted that warmed plants would show reduced photosynthetic activity and growth, primarily due to the greater stomatal limitation imposed by faster and more severe soil drying under warming. On average, warming reduced net photosynthetic rates by 36\% across the study period. Despite this strong response, warming did not affect stomatal conductance and transpiration. The reduction of peak photosynthetic rates with warming was more pronounced in a drought year than in years with near-average rainfall (75\% and 25\textendash{}40\% reductions relative to controls, respectively), with no indications of photosynthetic acclimation to warming through time. Warmed plants had lower leaf N and P contents, $\delta$13C, and sparser and smaller leaves than control plants. Warming reduced shoot dry mass production by 31\%. However, warmed plants were able to cope with large reductions in net photosynthesis, leaf area, and shoot biomass production without changes in postsummer survival rates. Our findings highlight the key role of nonstomatal factors (biochemical and/or nutritional) in reducing net carbon assimilation rates and growth under warming, which has important implications for projections of plant carbon balance under the warmer and drier climatic scenario predicted for drylands worldwide. Projected climate warming over the coming decades could reduce net primary production by about one-third in semi-arid gypsum shrublands dominated by H.~squamatum.},

Three bacteria previously isolated from grapevine roots and adjacent soil (Microbacterium imperiale Rz19M10, Kocuria erythromyxa Rt5M10 and Terribacillus saccharophilus Rt17M10) were tested as PGPR. After 30 days since root inoculation of in vitro grown Vitis vinifera cv. Malbec plants, the monoterpenes $\alpha$-pinene, terpinolene and 4-carene, and the sesquiterpene nerolidol were detected only in bacterized-plant leaves. Also, the concentrations of the diterpenes $\alpha$ and $\gamma$-tocopherol, and the sterols sitosterol and lupeol were significantly enhanced compared to controls. The leaf extracts of bacterized plants showed photoprotective properties since they decreased the oxygen consumption (that is photo-oxidation) of the amino acid tryptophan in a sensitized solution, thus indicating an increment of the antioxidant capacity of the tissues. In addition, experiments with $\alpha$-pinene and nerolidol standards showed the capability to intercept reactive oxygen species in the sensitized solution. Moreover, bacterized plants infected with the pathogen Botrytis cinerea showed a reduction in the lesion diameter compared with non-bacterized plants. The results suggest that M. imperiale, K. erythromyxa and mainly T. saccharophilus are able to induce a systemic response that trigger increases on monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, tocopherols and membrane sterols. These compounds enhance the antioxidant capacity in leaf tissues that may help grapevine to cope with stresses.},

  abstract = {Plant respiration constitutes a massive carbon flux to the atmosphere, and a major control on the evolution of the global carbon cycle. It therefore has the potential to modulate levels of climate change due to the human burning of fossil fuels. Neither current physiological nor terrestrial biosphere models adequately describe its short-term temperature response, and even minor differences in the shape of the response curve can significantly impact estimates of ecosystem carbon release and/or storage. Given this, it is critical to establish whether there are predictable patterns in the shape of the respiration\textendash{}temperature response curve, and thus in the intrinsic temperature sensitivity of respiration across the globe. Analyzing measurements in a comprehensive database for 231 species spanning 7 biomes, we demonstrate that temperature-dependent increases in leaf respiration do not follow a commonly used exponential function. Instead, we find a decelerating function as leaves warm, reflecting a declining sensitivity to higher temperatures that is remarkably uniform across all biomes and plant functional types. Such convergence in the temperature sensitivity of leaf respiration suggests that there are universally applicable controls on the temperature response of plant energy metabolism, such that a single new function can predict the temperature dependence of leaf respiration for global vegetation. This simple function enables straightforward description of plant respiration in the land-surface components of coupled earth system models. Our cross-biome analyses shows significant implications for such fluxes in cold climates, generally projecting lower values compared with previous estimates.},

  abstract = {There are numerous studies describing how growth conditions influence the efficiency of C4 photosynthesis. However, it remains unclear how changes in the biochemical capacity versus leaf anatomy drives this acclimation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine how growth light and nitrogen availability influence leaf anatomy, biochemistry and the efficiency of the CO2 concentrating mechanism in Miscanthus \texttimes{} giganteus. There was an increase in the mesophyll cell wall surface area but not cell well thickness in the high-light (HL) compared to the low-light (LL) grown plants suggesting a higher mesophyll conductance in the HL plants, which also had greater photosynthetic capacity. Additionally, the HL plants had greater surface area and thickness of bundle-sheath cell walls compared to LL plants, suggesting limited differences in bundle-sheath CO2 conductance because the increased area was offset by thicker cell walls. The gas exchange estimates of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPc) activity were significantly less than the in vitro PEPc activity, suggesting limited substrate availability in the leaf due to low mesophyll CO2 conductance. Finally, leakiness was similar across all growth conditions and generally did not change under the different measurement light conditions. However, differences in the stable isotope composition of leaf material did not correlate with leakiness indicating that dry matter isotope measurements are not a good proxy for leakiness. Taken together, these data suggest that the CO2 concentrating mechanism in Miscanthus is robust under low-light and limited nitrogen growth conditions, and that the observed changes in leaf anatomy and biochemistry likely help to maintain this efficiency.},

Here, we tested the relationship between leaf economics traits, including leaf nitrogen concentration and leaf dry mass per area, and leaf hydraulic traits including stomatal density and vein density in five tropical-subtropical forests. Surprisingly, these two suites of traits were statistically decoupled. This decoupling suggests that independent trait dimensions exist within a leaf, with leaf economics dimension corresponding to light capture and tissue longevity, and the hydraulic dimension to water-use and leaf temperature maintenance. Clearly, leaf economics and hydraulic traits can vary independently, thus allowing for more possible plant trait combinations. Compared with a single trait dimension, multiple trait dimensions may better enable species adaptations to multifarious niche dimensions, promote diverse plant strategies and facilitate species coexistence.},

  abstract = {At over 40 years, the Landsat satellites provide the longest temporal record of space-based land surface observations, and the successful 2013 launch of the Landsat-8 is continuing this legacy. Ideally, the Landsat data record should be consistent over the Landsat sensor series. The Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) has improved calibration, signal to noise characteristics, higher 12-bit radiometric resolution, and spectrally narrower wavebands than the previous Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM +). Reflective wavelength differences between the two Landsat sensors depend also on the surface reflectance and atmospheric state which are difficult to model comprehensively. The orbit and sensing geometries of the Landsat-8 OLI and Landsat-7 ETM + provide swath edge overlapping paths sensed only one day apart. The overlap regions are sensed in alternating backscatter and forward scattering orientations so Landsat bi-directional reflectance effects are evident but approximately balanced between the two sensors when large amounts of time series data are considered. Taking advantage of this configuration a total of 59 million 30 m corresponding sensor observations extracted from 6317 Landsat-7 ETM + and Landsat-8 OLI images acquired over three winter and three summer months for all the conterminous United States (CONUS) are compared. Results considering different stages of cloud and saturation filtering, and filtering to reduce one day surface state differences, demonstrate the importance of appropriate per-pixel data screening. Top of atmosphere (TOA) and atmospherically corrected surface reflectance for the spectrally corresponding visible, near infrared and shortwave infrared bands, and derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), are compared and their differences quantified. On average the OLI TOA reflectance is greater than the ETM + TOA reflectance for all bands, with greatest differences in the near-infrared (NIR) and the shortwave infrared bands due to the quite different spectral response functions between the sensors. The atmospheric correction reduces the mean difference in the NIR and shortwave infrared but increases the mean difference in the visible bands. Regardless of whether TOA or surface reflectance are used to generate NDVI, on average, for vegetated soil and vegetation surfaces (0 $\leq$ NDVI $\leq$ 1), the OLI NDVI is greater than the ETM + NDVI. Statistical functions to transform between the comparable sensor bands and sensor NDVI values are presented so that the user community may apply them in their own research to improve temporal continuity between the Landsat-7 ETM + and Landsat-8 OLI sensor data. The transformation functions were developed using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and were fit quite reliably (r2 values \&gt; 0.7 for the reflectance data and \&gt; 0.9 for the NDVI data, p-values \&lt; 0.0001).},

In 2011, we completed and launched the CAO-2 next generation Airborne Taxonomic Mapping Systems (AToMS), which includes a high-fidelity visible-to-shortwave infrared (VSWIR) imaging spectrometer (380\textendash{}2510 nm), dual-laser waveform light detection and ranging (LiDAR) scanner, and high spatial resolution visible-to-near infrared (VNIR) imaging spectrometer (365\textendash{}1052 nm). Here, we describe how multiple data streams from these sensors can be fused using hardware and software co-alignment and processing techniques. With these data streams, we quantitatively demonstrate that precision data fusion greatly increases the dimensionality of the ecological information derived from remote sensing. We compare the data dimensionality of two contrasting scenes \textemdash{} a built environment at Stanford University and a lowland tropical forest in Amazonia. Principal components analysis revealed 336 dimensions (degrees of freedom) in the Stanford case, and 218 dimensions in the Amazon. The Amazon case presents what could be the highest level of remotely sensed data dimensionality ever reported for a forested ecosystem. Simulated misalignment of data streams reduced the effective information content by up to 48\%, highlighting the critical role of achieving high precision when undertaking multi-sensor fusion. The instrumentation and methods described here are a pathfinder for future airborne applications undertaken by the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and other organizations.},

  abstract = {The influence of the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) on important hydroclimatic variables during years of neutral ENSO for 84 climate divisions in the western United States is analyzed from 1925 to 1998. When the 34 neutral ENSO years are split by cold (12 yr) and warm (22 yr) PDOs, the resulting winter precipitation patterns are spatially similar to those that occur during years of La Ni{\~n}a\textendash{}cold PDO and, to a lesser extent, years of El Ni{\~n}o\textendash{}warm PDO, respectively, although the characteristic ENSO dipole is not evident. The PDO influence is similar when the winter Palmer drought severity index is analyzed, although the core area of influence moves from the Southwest to the northern Rockies. Correlations between Ni{\~n}o-3.4 SSTs and the hydroclimatic variables reverse sign when the neutral ENSO years are split by PDO phase. The greatest difference between correlations occurs in the characteristic dipole between the Pacific Northwest and the desert Southwest. Since seasonal forecast guidance based on ENSO conditions in the tropical Pacific often yields a forecast of ``equal chances'' during years of neutral ENSO, forecasters may be able to improve their forecasts for the southwestern United States depending on if the PDO is known to be in the cold (drier than normal) or warm (wetter than normal) phase. However, this can be difficult to implement considering the current uncertainty of the phase of the PDO.},

  abstract = {The ecology of forest and savanna trees species will largely determine the structure and dynamics of the forest\textendash{}savanna boundaries, but little is known about the constraints to leaf trait variation imposed by selective forces and evolutionary history during the process of savanna invasion by forest species. We compared seasonal patterns in leaf traits related to leaf structure, carbon assimilation, water, and nutrient relations in 10 congeneric species pairs, each containing one savanna species and one forest species. All individuals were growing in dystrophic oxisols in a fire-protected savanna of Central Brazil. We tested the hypothesis that forest species would be more constrained by seasonal drought and nutrient-poor soils than their savanna congeners. We also hypothesized that habitat, rather than phylogeny, would explain more of the interspecific variance in leaf traits of the studied species. We found that throughout the year forest trees had higher specific leaf area (SLA) but lower integrated water use efficiency than savanna trees. Forest and savanna species maintained similar values of predawn and midday leaf water potential along the year. Lower values were measured in the dry season. However, this was achieved by a stronger regulation of stomatal conductance and of CO2 assimilation on an area basis (A area) in forest trees, particularly toward the end of the dry season. Relative to savanna trees, forest trees maintained similar (P, K, Ca, and Mg) or slightly higher (N) leaf nutrient concentrations. For the majority of traits, more variance was explained by phylogeny, than by habitat of origin, with the exception of SLA, leaf N concentration, and A area, which were apparently subjected to different selective pressures in the savanna and forest environments. In conclusion, water shortage during extended droughts would be more limiting for forest trees than nutrient-poor soils.},

Approaches based on species richness on the one hand, and on functional traits and types on the other, have been extremely productive in recent years, but attempts to connect their findings have been rare. Crossfertilization between these two approaches is a promising way of gaining mechanistic insight into the links between plant diversity and ecosystem processes and contributing to practical management for the conservation of diversity and ecosystem services.},

We quantified the C storage of trees and the aboveground NPP in an early successional secondary birch forest (birch forest) and a late successional mixed broadleaf-Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis) forest (mixed forest) in northeastern China. We found that: 1) tree C storage in the mixed forest (120.3 Mg C ha-1) was significantly higher than that in the birch forest (78.5 Mg C ha-1), whereas the aboveground NPP was not different between the two forest types; and 2) only stand density had a positive linear relationship with tree C storage and aboveground NPP in the birch forest. In the mixed forest, both tree C storage and aboveground NPP were significantly affected by the combination of the stand density and species richness. The tree C storage to stand density and species richness relationships were hump-shaped. The aboveground NPP increased with increasing stand density, but its relationship to species richness was hump-shaped. We conclude that the effect of stand density and species richness on tree C storage and aboveground NPP was influenced by forest stand succession, and such effects should be considered in studying stand density- and species richness- ecosystem function (e.g., C storage and NPP) relationships in temperate forest ecosystems.},

  abstract = {The potential for model\textendash{}data synthesis is growing in importance as we enter an era of `big data', greater connectivity and faster computation. Realizing this potential requires that the research community broaden its perspective about how and why they interact with models. Models can be viewed as scaffolds that allow data at different scales to inform each other through our understanding of underlying processes. Perceptions of relevance, accessibility and informatics are presented as the primary barriers to broader adoption of models by the community, while an inability to fully utilize the breadth of expertise and data from the community is a primary barrier to model improvement. Overall, we promote a community-based paradigm to model\textendash{}data synthesis and highlight some of the tools and techniques that facilitate this approach. Scientific workflows address critical informatics issues in transparency, repeatability and automation, while intuitive, flexible web-based interfaces make running and visualizing models more accessible. Bayesian statistics provides powerful tools for assimilating a diversity of data types and for the analysis of uncertainty. Uncertainty analyses enable new measurements to target those processes most limiting our predictive ability.

  abstract = {Impacts of human civilization on ecosystems threaten global biodiversity. In a changing environment, traditional in situ approaches to biodiversity monitoring have made significant steps forward to quantify and evaluate BD at many scales but still, these methods are limited to comparatively small areas. Earth observation (EO) techniques may provide a solution to overcome this shortcoming by measuring entities of interest at different spatial and temporal scales.

This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the role of EO to detect, describe, explain, predict and assess biodiversity. Here, we focus on three main aspects related to biodiversity - taxonomic diversity, functional diversity and structural diversity, which integrate different levels of organization - molecular, genetic, individual, species, populations, communities, biomes, ecosystems and landscapes. In particular, we discuss the recording of taxonomic elements of biodiversity through the identification of animal and plant species. We highlight the importance of the spectral traits (ST) and spectral trait variations (STV) concept for EO-based biodiversity research. Furthermore we provide examples of spectral traits/spectral trait variations used in EO applications for quantifying taxonomic diversity, functional diversity and structural diversity. We discuss the use of EO to monitor biodiversity and habitat quality using different remote-sensing techniques. Finally, we suggest specifically important steps for a better integration of EO in biodiversity research.

EO methods represent an affordable, repeatable and comparable method for measuring, describing, explaining and modelling taxonomic, functional and structural diversity. Upcoming sensor developments will provide opportunities to quantify spectral traits, currently not detectable with EO, and will surely help to describe biodiversity in more detail. Therefore, new concepts are needed to tightly integrate EO sensor networks with the identification of biodiversity. This will mean taking completely new directions in the future to link complex, large data, different approaches and models.},

  abstract = {Carbon (C) uptake rates in many forests are sustained, or decline only briefly, following disturbances that partially defoliate the canopy. The mechanisms supporting such functional resistance to moderate forest disturbance are largely unknown. We used a large-scale experiment, in which $>$6700 Populus (aspen) and Betula (birch) trees were stem-girdled within a 39-ha area, to identify mechanisms sustaining C uptake through partial canopy defoliation. The Forest Accelerated Succession Experiment in northern Michigan, USA, employs a suite of C-cycling measurements within paired treatment and control meteorological flux tower footprints. We found that enhancement of canopy light-use efficiency and maintenance of light absorption maintained net ecosystem production (NEP) and aboveground wood net primary production (NPP) when leaf-area index (LAI) of the treatment forest temporarily declined by nearly half its maximum value. In the year following peak defoliation, redistribution of nitrogen (N) in the treatment forest from senescent early successional aspen and birch to non-girdled later successional species facilitated the recovery of total LAI to pre-disturbance levels. Sustained canopy physiological competency following disturbance coincided with a downward shift in maximum canopy height, indicating that compensatory photosynthetic C uptake by undisturbed, later successional subdominant and subcanopy vegetation supported C-uptake resistance to disturbance. These findings have implications for ecosystem management and modeling, demonstrating that forests may tolerate considerable leaf-area losses without diminishing rates of C uptake. We conclude that the resistance of C uptake to moderate disturbance depends not only on replacement of lost leaf area, but also on rapid compensatory photosynthetic C uptake during defoliation by emerging later successional species.},

  abstract = {We developed a new algorithm called Tmask (multiTemporal mask) for automated masking of cloud, cloud shadow, and snow for multitemporal Landsat images. This algorithm consists of two steps. The first step is based on a single-date algorithm called Fmask (Function of mask) that initially screens most of the clouds, cloud shadows, and snow. The second step benefits from the extra temporal information from the remaining ``clear'' pixels and further improves the cloud, cloud shadow, and snow mask. Three Top Of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance bands (Bands 2, 4, and 5 \textemdash{} Landsat-7 band numbering) are used in a Robust Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (RIRLS) method to estimate a time series model for each pixel. By comparing model estimates with Landsat observations for the three spectral bands, the Tmask algorithm is capable of detecting any remaining clouds, cloud shadows, and snow for an entire stack of Landsat images. Generally, this algorithm will not falsely identify land cover changes as clouds, cloud shadows, or snow, as it is capable of modeling land cover change. The multitemporal images also provide extra information for better discrimination of cloud and snow, which is difficult for single-date algorithm. A snow threshold is derived for Band 5 TOA reflectance for each pixel at each specific time based on a modified Norwegian Linear Reflectance-to-Snow-Cover (NLR) algorithm. By comparing the results of Tmask with a single-date algorithm (Fmask) for multitemporal Landsat images located at Path 12 Row 31, significant improvements are observed for identification of clouds, cloud shadows, and snow. The most significant improvement is observed for cloud shadow detection. Many of the errors in cloud, cloud shadow, and snow detection observed in Fmask are corrected by the Tmask algorithm. The goal is development of a cloud, cloud shadow, and snow detection algorithm that results in a multitemporal stack of images that is free of ``noise'' factors and thus suitable for detection of land cover change.},

  abstract = {People depend on benefits provided by ecological systems. Understanding how these ecosystem services \textendash{} and the ecosystem properties underpinning them \textendash{} respond to drivers of change is therefore an urgent priority. We address this challenge through developing a novel risk-assessment framework that integrates ecological and evolutionary perspectives on functional traits to determine species' effects on ecosystems and their tolerance of environmental changes. We define Specific Effect Function (SEF) as the per-gram or per capita capacity of a species to affect an ecosystem property, and Specific Response Function (SRF) as the ability of a species to maintain or enhance its population as the environment changes. Our risk assessment is based on the idea that the security of ecosystem services depends on how effects (SEFs) and tolerances (SRFs) of organisms \textendash{} which both depend on combinations of functional traits \textendash{} correlate across species and how they are arranged on the species' phylogeny. Four extreme situations are theoretically possible, from minimum concern when SEF and SRF are neither correlated nor show a phylogenetic signal, to maximum concern when they are negatively correlated (i.e., the most important species are the least tolerant) and phylogenetically patterned (lacking independent backup). We illustrate the assessment with five case studies, involving both plant and animal examples. However, the extent to which the frequency of the four plausible outcomes, or their intermediates, apply more widely in real-world ecological systems is an open question that needs empirical evidence, and suggests a research agenda at the interface of evolutionary biology and ecosystem ecology.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.rse.2004.12.022},
  abstract = {Extensive estimates of forest productivity are required to understand the relationships between shifting land use, changing climate and carbon storage and fluxes. Aboveground net primary production of wood (NPPAw) is a major component of total NPP and of net ecosystem production (NEP). Remote sensing of NPP and NPPAw is generally based on light use efficiency or process-based biogeochemistry models. However, validating these large area flux estimates remains a major challenge. In this study we develop an independent approach to estimating NPPAw, based on stand age and biomass, that could be implemented over a large area and used in validation efforts. Stand age is first mapped by iterative unsupervised classification of a multi-temporal sequence of images from a passive optical sensor (e.g. Landsat TM). Stand age is then cross-tabulated with estimates of stand height and aboveground biomass from lidar remote sensing. NPPAw is then calculated as the average increment in lidar-estimated biomass over the time period determined using change detection. In western Oregon, productivity estimates made using this method compared well with forest inventory estimates and were significantly different than estimates from a spatially distributed biogeochemistry model. The generality of the relationship between lidar-based canopy characteristics and stand biomass means that this approach could potentially be widely applicable to landscapes with stand replacing disturbance regimes, notably in regions where forest inventories are not routinely maintained.},

HyspIRI would combine the established capability of a VSWIR sensor to discriminate plant species and estimate accurate cover fractions with improved Land Surface Temperatures (LST) retrieved from the TIR sensor. We evaluate potential synergies between Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) maps of dominant plant species and mixed species assemblages, fractional cover, and MODIS/ASTER Airborne Simulator (MASTER) LST utilizing multiple flight lines acquired in July 2011 in the Santa Barbara, California area. Species composition and green vegetation (GV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), impervious, and soil cover fractions were mapped using Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis with a spectral library derived from 7.5 m imagery. Temperature-Emissivity Separation (TES) was accomplished using the MASTER TES algorithm. Pixel-based accuracy exceeded 50\% for 23 species and land cover classes and approached 75\% based on pixel majority in reference polygons. An inverse relationship was observed between GV fractions and LST. This relationship varied by dominant plant species/vegetation class, generating unique LST\textendash{}GV clusters. We hypothesize clustering is a product of environmental controls on species distributions, such as slope, aspect, and elevation as well as species-level differences in canopy structure, rooting depth, water use efficiency, and available soil moisture, suggesting that relationships between LST and plant species will vary seasonally. The potential of HyspIRI as a means of providing these seasonal relationships is discussed.},

  abstract = {1.The comparable and integrated nature of plant functional types and advances in high spectral resolution remote sensing techniques (i.e., imaging spectroscopy) make their combination highly interesting for spatially continuous and repeatable large-scale ecosystem monitoring. Depending on physical environment and stress, plants invest in co-varying biochemical and structural traits, influencing spectral characteristics of vegetation. These traits are assumed to bear a more direct causal relationship to plant functional types than to plant life/growth forms. However, the connection between a vegetation community's functional and spectral response remains to be established. 2.We assessed the correlation structure between i) biochemical and structural vegetation traits (biomass, dry matter content, nitrogen content, neutral detergent fibre content), ii) plant life/growth forms, and iii) seven plant functional types of two categories (strategy types, indicator values) collected in heterogeneous alpine grassland. We then used airborne imaging spectroscopy data from the same area to model and predict plant life/growth forms and plant functional types at the vegetation community level using partial least squares regression (PLSR), and validated our models based on an independent dataset. 3.We found high correlations between many of the biochemical and structural vegetation traits, plant life/growth forms and plant functional types tested. Using airborne imaging spectroscopy data, we successfully modelled and predicted most plant life/growth forms (R2 max. = 0.56) and all plant functional types (R2 max. = 0.62). However, model performance for plant life/growth forms decreased substantially during external validation and overall model consistency was low (average change in R2 = 72\%), while plant functional type models were much more consistent (average change in R2 = 20\%). Based on our findings, we developed a conceptual framework using the theory and methodology of vegetation ecology and imaging spectroscopy to link the vegetation community's functional to its spectral signature. 4.Our results encourage the use of plant functional types in imaging spectroscopy in order to aid the large-scale monitoring of ecosystems, which is particularly important given the increased availability of airborne data and the prospective launches of spaceborne instruments in the near future.

  abstract = {The Great Plains of North America are susceptible to multi-year droughts, such as the 1930s `Dust Bowl'. The droughts have been linked to SST variability in the Pacific and Atlantic basins. This observationally rooted analysis shows the SST influence in multi-year droughts and wet episodes over the Great Plains to be significantly more extensive than previously indicated. The remarkable statistical reconstruction of the major hydroclimate episodes attests to the extent of the SST influence in nature, and facilitated evaluation of the basin contributions. We find the Atlantic SSTs to be especially influential in forcing multi-year droughts; often, more than the Pacific ones. The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), in particular, contributed the most in two of the four reconstructed episodes (Dust Bowl Spring, 1980s fall wetness), accounting for almost half the precipitation signal in each case. The AMO influence on continental precipitation was provided circulation context from analysis of NOAA's 20th Century Atmospheric Reanalysis. A hypothesis for how the AMO atmospheric circulation anomalies are generated from AMO SSTs is proposed to advance discussion of the influence pathways of the mid-to-high latitude SST anomalies. Our analysis suggests that the La Nina\textendash{}US Drought paradigm, operative on interannual time scales, has been conferred excessive relevance on decadal time scales in the recent literature.},

In order to understand the nutrient limitation at landscape scale, remote sensing techniques offer that opportunity. The objective of this study is to investigate the utility of field spectroscopy and a potential of hyperspectral mapper (HyMap) spectra to estimate foliar N:P ratio. Field spectral measurements were undertaken, and grass samples were collected for foliar N and P extraction. The foliar N:P ratio prediction models were developed using partial least square regression (PLSR) with original spectra and transformed spectra for field and the resampled field spectra to HyMap. Spectral transformations included the continuum removal (CR), water removal (WR), first difference derivative (FD) and log transformation (Log(1/R)). The results showed that CR and WR spectra in combination with PLSR predicted foliar N:P ratio with higher accuracy as compared to FD and R, using field spectra. For HyMap spectral analysis, addition to CR and WR, FD achieved higher estimation accuracy. The performance of FD, CR and WR spectra were attributed to their ability to minimize sensor and water effects on the fresh leaf spectra, respectively. The study demonstrated a potential to predict foliar N:P ratio using field and HyMap simulated spectra and shortwave infrared (SWIR) found to be highly sensitive to foliar N:P ratio. The study recommends the prediction of foliar N:P ratio at landscape level using airborne hyperspectral data and could be used by the resource managers, park managers, farmers and ecologists to understand the feeding patterns, resource selection and distribution of herbivores (i.e. wild and livestock).},

How Amazon forests responded to these droughts is critical for the future of the Earth's climate system. It is only possible to assess Amazon forests' response to the droughts in large areal extent through satellite remote sensing. Here, we used the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation index (VI) data to assess Amazon forests' response to droughts, and compared the results with those from the standard (Collection 5 and Collection 6) MODIS VI data. Overall, the MAIAC data reveal more realistic Amazon forests inter-annual greenness dynamics than the standard MODIS data. Our results from the MAIAC data suggest that: (1) the droughts decreased the greenness (i.e., photosynthetic activity) of Amazon forests; (2) the Amazon wet season precipitation reduction induced by El Ni{\~n}o events could also lead to reduced photosynthetic activity of Amazon forests; and (3) in the subsequent year after the water stresses, the greenness of Amazon forests recovered from the preceding decreases. However, as previous research shows droughts cause Amazon forests to reduce investment in tissue maintenance and defense, it is not clear whether the photosynthesis of Amazon forests will continue to recover after future water stresses, because of the accumulated damages caused by the droughts.},

Measurement and model uncertainties make the inverse problem ill posed, inducing difficulties and inaccuracies in the search for the solution. This study focuses on the use of prior information to reduce the uncertainties associated to the estimation of canopy biophysical variables in the radiative transfer model inversion process. For this purpose, lookup table (LUT), quasi-Newton algorithm (QNT), and neural network (NNT) inversion techniques were adapted to account for prior information. Results were evaluated over simulated reflectance data sets that allow a detailed analysis of the effect of measurement and model uncertainties. Results demonstrate that the use of prior information significantly improves canopy biophysical variables estimation. LUT and QNT are sensitive to model uncertainties. Conversely, NNT techniques are generally less accurate. However, in our conditions, its accuracy is little dependent significantly on modeling or measurement error. We also observed that bias in the reflectance measurements due to miscalibration did not impact very much the accuracy of biophysical estimation.},

  abstract = {Leaf economics spectrum (LES) theory suggests a universal trade-off between resource acquisition and storage strategies in plants, expressed in relationships between foliar nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), leaf mass per area (LMA), and photosynthesis. However, how environmental conditions mediate LES trait interrelationships, particularly at large biospheric scales, remains unknown because of a lack of spatially explicit data, which ultimately limits our understanding of ecosystem processes, such as primary productivity and biogeochemical cycles. We used airborne imaging spectroscopy and geospatial modeling to generate, to our knowledge, the first biospheric maps of LES traits, here centered on 76 million ha of Andean and Amazonian forest, to assess climatic and geophysical determinants of LES traits and their interrelationships. Elevation and substrate were codominant drivers of leaf trait distributions. Multiple additional climatic and geophysical factors were secondary determinants of plant traits. Anticorrelations between N and LMA followed general LES theory, but topo-edaphic conditions strongly mediated and, at times, eliminated this classic relationship. We found no evidence for simple P\textendash{}LMA or N\textendash{}P trade-offs in forest canopies; rather, we mapped a continuum of N\textendash{}P\textendash{}LMA interactions that are sensitive to elevation and temperature. Our results reveal nested climatic and geophysical filtering of LES traits and their interrelationships, with important implications for predictions of forest productivity and acclimation to rapid climate change.},

  abstract = {Lack of information on ecological characteristics of species across different continents hinders development of general world-scale quantitative vegetation dynamic models. We constructed common scales of shade, drought, and waterlogging tolerance for 806 North American, European/West Asian, and East Asian temperate shrubs and trees representing about 40\% of the extant natural Northern Hemisphere species pool. These scales were used to test the hypotheses that shade tolerance is negatively related to drought and waterlogging tolerances, and that these correlations vary among continents and plant functional types. We observed significant negative correlations among shade and drought tolerance rankings for all data pooled, and separately for every continent and plant functional type, except for evergreen angiosperms. Another significant trade-off was found for drought and waterlogging tolerance for all continents, and for evergreen and deciduous angiosperms, but not for gymnosperms. For all data pooled, for Europe and East Asia, and for evergreen and deciduous angiosperms, shade tolerance was also negatively associated with waterlogging tolerance. Quantile regressions revealed that the negative relationship between shade and drought tolerance was significant for species growing in deep to moderate shade and that the negative relationship between shade and waterlogging tolerance was significant for species growing in moderate shade to high light, explaining why all relationships between different tolerances were negative according to general regression analyses. Phylogenetic signal in the tolerance to any one of the three environmental factors studied was significant but low, with only 21\textendash{}24\% of cladogram nodes exhibiting significant conservatism. The inverse relationships between different tolerances were significant in phylogenetically independent analyses both for the overall pool of species and for two multispecies genera (Pinus and Quercus) for which reliable molecular phylogenies were available. Only 2.6\textendash{}10.3\% of the species were relatively tolerant to two environmental stresses simultaneously (tolerance value $\geq$3), and only three species were tolerant to all three stresses, supporting the existence of functional trade-offs in adjusting to multiple environmental limitations. These trade-offs represent a constraint for niche differentiation, reducing the diversity of plant responses to the many combinations of irradiance and water supply that are found in natural ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability (AMV), also known as the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO), is characterized by a sharp rise and fall of the North Atlantic basin-wide sea surface temperatures (SST) on multi-decadal time scales. Widespread consequences of these rapid temperature swings were noted in many previous studies. Among these are the drying of Sahel in the 1960\textendash{}70s and change in the frequency and intensity of Atlantic hurricanes on multi-decadal time scales. Given the short instrumental data records (about a century long) the central question is whether these climate fluctuations are robustly linked with the AMV and to what extent are these connections subject to changes in a changing climate. Here we address this issue by using the CMIP3 simulations for the 20th, 21st, and pre-industrial eras with 23 IPCC models. While models tend to produce AMV of shorter time scales and less periodic than suggested by the observations, the spatial structures of the SST anomaly patterns, and their association with worldwide precipitation, are surprisingly similar between models (with differing external forcing) and observations. Our results confirm the strong link between AMV and Sahel rainfall and suggest a clear physical mechanism for the linkage in terms of meridional shifts of the Atlantic ITCZ. The results also help clarify influences that may not be robust, such as the impacts over North America, India, and Australia.},

  abstract = {Observations of terrestrial chlorophyll fluorescence and the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) from space have the potential to improve estimates of global carbon exchange. However the relationship between photosynthetic rate and these measurements is complicated by several factors that relate to the dissipation of absorbed light energy via both photochemical (photosynthesis) and non-photochemical pathways. Numerical simulations of physiological remote sensing signals require the coupling of physically-based radiative transfer models with models of physiological dynamics. These schemes provide the quantitative frameworks from which physiological information can be extracted from remote sensing observations of vegetation, helping to resolve the aforementioned complexities. We present such a framework that links physiological fluorescence theory with spectral remote sensing type measurements at the leaf scale. We show how a simple expression can be used to predict the quantum yield of photochemistry ($\Phi$PSII), a proxy for photosynthetic efficiency, from spectral measurements and modelled non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). We tested two alternate models of NPQ; one process-based (PHOTOII) and the other empirical, based on visible region reflectance changes (the PRI). We used a Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer (MCRT) model to retrieve the separated yields of chlorophyll fluorescence from photosystems II and I. Measurements of dynamic spectral fluorescence, the PRI, hemispherical reflectance and transmittance, saturation pulse integrated fluorescence and pigment contents were collected from maple leaves and used to calibrate and validate the modelling framework. Both NPQ models reproduced the observed photochemical and non-photochemical dynamics. Future work is recommended to scale the framework across space, time and species.},

  abstract = {Spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis (Kirby)) outbreaks cause widespread mortality of Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii (Parry ex Engelm)) within the subalpine forests of the western United States. Early detection of infestations could allow forest managers to mitigate outbreaks or anticipate a response to tree mortality and the potential effects on ecosystem services of interest. However, the subtle changes in the foliage of infested spruce make early detection difficult. An experiment was conducted in southern Colorado to determine important wavelengths for detecting early-stage (i.e. recently infested) spruce beetle infestation in Engelmann spruce. Spectral reflectance from non-infested and recently infested spruce needles were obtained using the ASDi Field-Spec Pro spectroradiometer. After pre-processing, random forest analysis was used to identify hyperspectral bands and aggregations of hyperspectral bands corresponding to Landsat TM bands and vegetation indices that effectively discriminated between non-infested and infested trees. Results show that the shortwave infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum was a key area for detecting early stages of spruce beetle infestation, likely due to the effects of beetle infestation on water transport within Engelmann spruce. The strong discriminability of bands in the shortwave infrared region indicates a potential for this spectral region to be used to detect early-stage spruce beetle infestation over larger areas using multispectral satellite imagery. In a preliminary trial, we found that a time series of reflectance in Landsat TM band 7 (shortwave infrared) was strongly correlated with the progression through time of a spruce beetle outbreak in southern Wyoming. These findings suggest that multispectral indicators of early-stage spruce beetle outbreak can be developed. These indicators are needed to better understand spatiotemporal dynamics of spruce beetle outbreaks, and can be used by forest managers to detect early stages of spruce beetle infestation and to potentially mitigate some spruce mortality.},

  abstract = {Grass nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations are direct indicators of rangeland quality and provide imperative information for sound management of wildlife and livestock. It is challenging to estimate grass N and P concentrations using remote sensing in the savanna ecosystems. These areas are diverse and heterogeneous in soil and plant moisture, soil nutrients, grazing pressures, and human activities. The objective of the study is to test the performance of non-linear partial least squares regression (PLSR) for predicting grass N and P concentrations through integrating in situ hyperspectral remote sensing and environmental variables (climatic, edaphic and topographic). Data were collected along a land use gradient in the greater Kruger National Park region. The data consisted of: (i) in situ-measured hyperspectral spectra, (ii) environmental variables and measured grass N and P concentrations. The hyperspectral variables included published starch, N and protein spectral absorption features, red edge position, narrow-band indices such as simple ratio (SR) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The results of the non-linear PLSR were compared to those of conventional linear PLSR. Using non-linear PLSR, integrating in situ hyperspectral and environmental variables yielded the highest grass N and P estimation accuracy (R2 = 0.81, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.08, and R2 = 0.80, RMSE = 0.03, respectively) as compared to using remote sensing variables only, and conventional PLSR. The study demonstrates the importance of an integrated modeling approach for estimating grass quality which is a crucial effort towards effective management and planning of protected and communal savanna ecosystems.},

  abstract = {The validation study of leaf area index (LAI) products over rugged surfaces not only gives additional insights into data quality of LAI products, but deepens understanding of uncertainties regarding land surface process models depended on LAI data over complex terrain. This study evaluated the performance of MODIS and GLASS LAI products using the intercomparison and direct validation methods over southwestern China. The spatio-temporal consistencies, such as the spatial distributions of LAI products and their statistical relationship as a function of topographic indices, time, and vegetation types, respectively, were investigated through intercomparison between MODIS and GLASS products during the period 2011\textendash{}2013. The accuracies and change ranges of these two products were evaluated against available LAI reference maps over 10 sampling regions which standed for typical vegetation types and topographic gradients in southwestern China.

The results show that GLASS LAI exhibits higher percentage of good quality data (i.e. successful retrievals) and smoother temporal profiles than MODIS LAI. The percentage of successful retrievals for MODIS and GLASS is vulnerable to topographic indices, especially to relief amplitude. Besides, the two products do not capture seasonal dynamics of crop, especially in spring over heterogeneously hilly regions. The yearly mean LAI differences between MODIS and GLASS are within $\pm$0.5 for 64.70\% of the total retrieval pixels over southwestern China. The spatial distribution of mean differences and temporal profiles of these two products are inclined to be dominated by vegetation types other than topographic indices. The spatial and temporal consistency of these two products is good over most area of grasses/cereal crops; however, it is poor for evergreen broadleaf forest. MODIS presents more reliable change range of LAI than GLASS through comparison with fine resolution reference maps over most of sampling regions. The accuracies of direct validation are obtained for GLASS LAI (r = 0.35, RMSE = 1.72, mean bias = -0.71) and MODIS LAI (r = 0.49, RMSE = 1.75, mean bias = -0.67). GLASS performs similarly to MODIS, but may be marginally inferior to MODIS based on our direct validation results. The validation experience demonstrates the necessity and importance of topographic consideration for LAI estimation over mountain areas. Considerable attention will be paid to the improvements of surface reflectance, retrieval algorithm and land cover types so as to enhance the quality of LAI products in topographically complex terrain.},

There was significant selection for leaf traits on both ends of the WLES spectrum, as well as significant genetic variation for these traits. In addition, genetic correlations between WLES traits were variable in strength and direction.

MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI, an index of canopy photosynthetic capacity) increased by 25\% with sunlight during the dry season across Amazon forests, opposite to ecosystem model predictions that water limitation should cause dry season declines in forest canopy photosynthesis. In contrast to intact forests, areas converted to pasture showed dry-season declines in EVI-derived photosynthetic capacity, presumably because removal of deep-rooted forest trees reduced access to deep soil water. Local canopy photosynthesis measured from eddy flux towers in both a rainforest and forest conversion site confirm our interpretation of satellite data, and suggest that basin-wide carbon fluxes can be constrained by integrating remote sensing and local flux measurements.},

Trait data thus represent the raw material for a wide range of research from evolutionary biology, community and functional ecology to biogeography. Here we present the global database initiative named TRY, which has united a wide range of the plant trait research community worldwide and gained an unprecedented buy-in of trait data: so far 93 trait databases have been contributed. The data repository currently contains almost three million trait entries for 69~000 out of the world's 300~000 plant species, with a focus on 52 groups of traits characterizing the vegetative and regeneration stages of the plant life cycle, including growth, dispersal, establishment and persistence. A first data analysis shows that most plant traits are approximately log-normally distributed, with widely differing ranges of variation across traits. Most trait variation is between species (interspecific), but significant intraspecific variation is also documented, up to 40\% of the overall variation. Plant functional types (PFTs), as commonly used in vegetation models, capture a substantial fraction of the observed variation \textendash{} but for several traits most variation occurs within PFTs, up to 75\% of the overall variation. In the context of vegetation models these traits would better be represented by state variables rather than fixed parameter values. The improved availability of plant trait data in the unified global database is expected to support a paradigm shift from species to trait-based ecology, offer new opportunities for synthetic plant trait research and enable a more realistic and empirically grounded representation of terrestrial vegetation in Earth system models.},

  abstract = {1. Essential Biodiversity Variable, Natural Capital, Biodiversity Indicator and Ecosystem Service are four concepts that underpin the most popular frameworks currently considered for helping to coordinate and structure biodiversity~monitoring efforts worldwide. Satellite Remote Sensing (SRS) has considerable potential to inform these initiatives. To date, however, discussions on the role of SRS in supporting these frameworks have mostly evolved independently; tend to be led by different groups; sometimes target slightly different scales; and are likely to reach different audiences. Because of this, there is some confusion among environmental managers and policymakers as to what the potential of SRS is or whether there is prospect in considering and promoting the use of satellite data for biodiversity conservation. 2. Here, we provide a brief overview of the role of SRS to date in informing these frameworks. Through a case study focused on the Sahara Desert ecosystem, we also demonstrate the current potential for SRS-based methodologies to support conservation in data-deficient areas and discuss the relative applicability of SRS-based metrics to each of these frameworks. 3. The relevance and use of SRS across the four frameworks are clearly variable, due to differences and ambiguity in definitions, and due to differences in monitoring priorities. Our case study illustrates the particularly high potential for SRS approaches to provide key information relevant to the Biodiversity Indicators framework in desert ecosystems; it also identifies SRS-based metrics relevant to all frameworks. 4. Altogether, this work highlights how more dialogue is required within the biodiversity-monitoring community for SRS to reach its full potential in conservation. In particular, agreement on what is needed in priority, given the realm of what is possible, will be of paramount importance to developing SRS-based products that are used by policymakers and international conventions.},

  abstract = {The seasonality of sunlight and rainfall regulates net primary production in tropical forests. Previous studies have suggested that light is more limiting than water for tropical forest productivity, consistent with greening of Amazon forests during the dry season in satellite data. We evaluated four potential mechanisms for the seasonal green-up phenomenon, including increases in leaf area or leaf reflectance, using a sophisticated radiative transfer model and independent satellite observations from lidar and optical sensors. Here we show that the apparent green up of Amazon forests in optical remote sensing data resulted from seasonal changes in near-infrared reflectance, an artefact of variations in sun-sensor geometry. Correcting this bidirectional reflectance effect eliminated seasonal changes in surface reflectance, consistent with independent lidar observations and model simulations with unchanging canopy properties. The stability of Amazon forest structure and reflectance over seasonal timescales challenges the paradigm of light-limited net primary production in Amazon forests and enhanced forest growth during drought conditions. Correcting optical remote sensing data for artefacts of sun-sensor geometry is essential to isolate the response of global vegetation to seasonal and interannual climate variability.},

  abstract = {* Understanding patterns of trait variation across environmental variability is necessary for development of ecological predictions. The leaf economic spectrum (LES) has demonstrated global trade-offs in leaf traits, but it is unclear whether such patterns are robust in local communities exposed to varying environments.

* We conducted separate greenhouse experiments to examine the effects of varying water-table depth and nitrogen availability on leaf-level trait values among a suite of co-occurring wetland species. We then assessed the effects of species-specific trait value responses on relationships predicted by LES and whether species responded similarly to variations in water-table depth and nitrogen availability.

* We found that both water-table depth and nitrogen availability had significant species by treatment interactions for specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen and photosynthetic rates, indicating species-specific responses to environmental variability. The responses of individual traits to different treatment levels were relatively consistent across species, but multivariate responses were more variable.

* We found that apart from significant relationships between specific leaf area and photosynthetic rate under some treatments, there was little support for the relationships predicted by the LES.

* These results suggest that, before trait-based ecology will be able to make progress towards using plant traits to predict responses of communities and ecosystems to changes in environmental drivers, considerable attention needs to be paid to the processes that control intraspecific trait variation.},

This study tested the application of leaf hyperspectral reflectance ($\lambda$ = 500\textendash{}2,400 nm) as a high-throughput phenotyping approach for rapid and accurate assessment of leaf photosynthetic and biochemical traits in maize (Zea mays). Leaf traits were measured with standard wet-laboratory and gas-exchange approaches alongside measurements of leaf reflectance. Partial least-squares regression was used to develop a measure of leaf chlorophyll content, nitrogen content, sucrose content, specific leaf area, maximum rate of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylation, [CO2]-saturated rate of photosynthesis, and leaf oxygen radical absorbance capacity from leaf reflectance spectra. Partial least-squares regression models accurately predicted five out of seven traits and were more accurate than previously used simple spectral indices for leaf chlorophyll, nitrogen content, and specific leaf area. Correlations among leaf traits and statistical inferences about differences among genotypes and treatments were similar for measured and modeled data. The hyperspectral reflectance approach to phenotyping was dramatically faster than traditional measurements, enabling over 1,000 rows to be phenotyped during midday hours over just 2 to 4 d, and offers a nondestructive method to accurately assess physiological and biochemical trait responses to environmental stress.},

It is illustrated over the solar spectral domain, with emphasis on LAI estimation using currently available algorithms developed for moderate resolution sensors. The principles of algorithms are first presented, distinguishing between canopy biophysical and radiometric data driven approaches that may use either radiative transfer models or experimental observations. Advantages and drawback are discussed with due attention to the operational character of the algorithms. Then the under-determination and ill-posedness nature of the inverse problem is described and illustrated. Finally, ways to improve the retrieval performances are presented, including the use of prior information, the exploitation of spatial and temporal constraints, and the interest in using holistic approaches based on the coupling of radiative transfer processes at several scales or levels. A conclusion is eventually proposed, discussing the three main components of retrieval approaches: retrieval techniques, radiative transfer models, and the exploitation of observations and ancillary information.},

  abstract = {Our objective was to model the average wood density in black spruce trees in representative stands across a boreal forest landscape based on relationships with predictor variables extracted from airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point cloud data. Increment core samples were collected from dominant or co-dominant black spruce trees in a network of 400 m2 plots distributed among forest stands representing the full range of species composition and stand development across a 1,231,707 ha forest management unit in northeastern Ontario, Canada. Wood quality data were generated from optical microscopy, image analysis, X-ray densitometry and diffractometry as employed in SilviScan\texttrademark. Each increment core was associated with a set of field measurements at the plot level as well as a suite of LiDAR-derived variables calculated on a 20 \texttimes{} 20 m raster from a wall-to-wall coverage at a resolution of \textasciitilde{}1 point m-2. We used a multiple linear regression approach to identify important predictor variables and describe relationships between stand structure and wood density for average black spruce trees in the stands we observed. A hierarchical classification model was then fitted using random forests to make spatial predictions of mean wood density for average trees in black spruce stands. The model explained 39 percent of the variance in the response variable, with an estimated root mean square error of 38.8 (kg$\cdot$m-3). Among the predictor variables, P20 (second decile LiDAR height in m) and quadratic mean diameter were most important. Other predictors describing canopy depth and cover were of secondary importance and differed according to the modeling approach. LiDAR-derived variables appear to capture differences in stand structure that reflect different constraints on growth rates, determining the proportion of thin-walled earlywood cells in black spruce stems, and ultimately influencing the pattern of variation in important wood quality attributes such as wood density. A spatial characterization of variation in a desirable wood quality attribute, such as density, enhances the possibility for value chain optimization, which could allow the forest industry to be more competitive through efficient planning for black spruce management by including an indication of suitability for specific products as a modeled variable derived from standard inventory data.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the relationship between North Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SST) and persistent drought in North America using modern observations, proxy paleo-data, and simulations from multiple climate models. The observational results show that persistent droughts in the Great Plains and the southwest North America are closely related to multidecadal variations of North Atlantic SST (Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillations, AMO). During the AMO warm (cold) phases, most of North America is dry (wet). This relationship is persistent since at least 1567 AD, as based on proxy SST for the North Atlantic and the reconstructed drought index for North America. On centennial timescales, proxy SST records from the North Atlantic and proxy drought records for North America suggest that major periods of AMO-like warm (cold) SST anomalies during the last 7.0 ka correspond to dry (wet) conditions in the Great Plains. The influence of North Atlantic SST on North American droughts is examined using simulations made by five global climate models. When forced by warm North Atlantic SST anomalies, all models captured significant drying over North America, despite some regional differences. Specifically, dry summers in the Great Plains and the southwest North America are simulated by all models. The precipitation response to a cold North Atlantic is much weaker and contains greater disagreement among the models. Overall, the ensemble of the five models could well reproduce the statistical relationship between the dry/wet fluctuations in the North America and North Atlantic SST anomalies. Our results suggest that North Atlantic SSTs are likely a major driver of decadal and centennial timescale circulation, including droughts, in North America. Possible mechanisms that connect North Atlantic SST with North American drought, as well as interactions between North Atlantic and tropical Pacific SST and their relative roles on drought are also discussed.},

One reason for this uncertainty lies in the multitude of methodological approaches to sampling biodiversity and productivity, some of which can be subjective. Remote sensing offers new, objective ways of assessing productivity and biodiversity. In this study, we tested the species richness\textendash{}productivity relationship using a common remote sensing index, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), as a measure of productivity in experimental prairie grassland plots (Cedar Creek). Our study spanned a growing season (May to October, 2014) to evaluate dynamic changes in the NDVI\textendash{}species richness relationship through time and in relation to environmental variables and phenology. We show that NDVI, which is strongly associated with vegetation percent cover and biomass, is related to biodiversity for this prairie site, but it is also strongly influenced by other factors, including canopy growth stage, short-term water stress and shifting flowering patterns. Remarkably, the NDVI-biodiversity correlation peaked at mid-season, a period of warm, dry conditions and anthesis, when NDVI reached a local minimum. These findings confirm a positive, but dynamic, productivity\textendash{}diversity relationship and highlight the benefit of optical remote sensing as an objective and non-invasive tool for assessing diversity\textendash{}productivity relationships.},

In this paper, we explored the effect of this transformation on vegetation productivity (magnitude, and seasonal and long-term variability) along aridity gradients which span from semiarid to subhumid conditions, considering exclusively those areas with summer rains ($>$66\%). Vegetation productivity was characterized with the proxy metric ``Enhanced Vegetation Index'' (EVI) (2000 to 2012 period), on 6186 natural and cultivated sampling points on five continents, and combined with a global climatology database by means of additive models for quantile regressions. Globally and regionally, cultivation amplified the seasonal and inter-annual variability of EVI without affecting its magnitude. Natural and cultivated systems maintained a similar and continuous increase of EVI with increasing water availability, yet achieved through contrasting ways. In natural systems, the productivity peak and the growing season length displayed concurrent steady increases with water availability, while in cultivated systems the productivity peak increased from semiarid to dry-subhumid conditions, and stabilized thereafter giving place to an increase in the growing season length towards wetter conditions. Our results help to understand and predict the ecological impacts of deforestation on vegetation productivity, a key ecosystem process linked to a broad range of services.},

The combination of broad scale, regional climatic, and more localized, site-level drivers presents a challenge when upscaling phenology from the plot to the region. Likewise, developing relationships between ground- or camera-based estimates and satellite imagery remains difficult due to the trade-off between temporal and spatial resolution. Landsat imagery, with its 16 day temporal resolution, is often thought of as being insufficient for timely observation of changes in vegetation throughout the year. However the free availability of the Landsat archive has enabled a major shift in the way Landsat imagery is processed moving towards pixel, rather than scene, based analyses. In this paper we build on previous research by examining the applicability and accuracy of Landsat derived phenology curves beyond deciduous stands into more mixed stands and conifer dominated forest types in the Rocky Mountains and foothills in Alberta, Canada. In addition, we discuss the application of these Landsat phenology curves to phenology of understorey species which are linked to habitat selection for free roaming wildlife, in particular grizzly bears. The agreement between Landsat- and camera-derived estimates of key phenological events was stronger for green-up (RMSE = 7 days) than for senescence (RMSE = 14 days). Our results show that yearly adjustment of green-up and senescence dates using available Landsat observations improved the agreement with camera-derived estimates when compared to average annual curves. Seasonal phenology transition dates accepted as valid ranged from 25\% for alpine herbaceous pixels to 75\% for closed deciduous, demonstrating the variable success of this approach across land cover types. Season transition dates were rejected if pixels lacked a strong enough green-up signal in Landsat spectral indices or if the estimated dates fell outside of the valid range. We conclude by investigating the spatial patterns of seasonal phenology at the Landsat scale, and assess the relative importance of regional vs. microsite conditions as well as the utility of these data for resource and wildlife management.},

Comparative analysis of these images by means of a newly developed software enabled us to calculate a) the increments of seedlings height and b) the percentage greenness of seedling leaves. Comparison of these parameters with destructive biomass measurements showed that the height traits can be used to estimate seedling growth for needle-leaved plant species whereas the greenness trait can be used for broad-leaved plant species.

  abstract = {Key messageIncreased nitrogen availability affects root capture and leaf resorption of nitrogen and phosphorus, and the corresponding acquisition-conservation tradeoff in slash pine forests.AbstractPlants may maintain their stoichiometric homeostasis via regulating root nutrient capture (acquisition) and leaf nutrient resorption (conservation). However, how increased nitrogen (N) availability affects root capture and leaf resorption of N and phosphorus (P), and the corresponding acquisition-conservation tradeoff remains unclear. We quantified N and P concentrations and their stoichiometric ratios of five nutrient pools (soils, absorptive fine-roots, transport fine-roots, green needles, and senesced needles) to investigate simultaneous responses of root capture (nutrient foraging potential and translocation) and needle resorption (efficiency and proficiency) to different rates and forms of N addition in a slash pine plantation in subtropical China. N addition increased N concentration in senesced needles, but reduced N capture capacity. N addition reduced P concentration in senesced needles (improved P resorption proficiency), but did not affect P capture capacity. N addition exerted no significant influence on resorption efficiency of N and P. N rate and form effects occurred only in nutrient foraging (N foraging was more responsive to high N rate and P foraging was more responsive to ammonium-based N addition), but not in nutrient translocation and resorption. The decreased root N capture capacity and increased senesced needle N concentration imply an alleviation of N limitation to plant growth and a behavior of plants to economize on cost for nutrient acquisition and conservation. P resorption rather than capture strategy was employed, indicating a more conservative use of P in response to exacerbated P limitation. These findings jointly suggest that the allocation of effort towards capture and resorption strategy depends on the strength and type of nutrient limitation. Our results have implications for understanding the acquisition-conservation tradeoff in plant nutrient economy and the mechanisms that plants maintain their stoichiometric homeostasis in the context of N loading.},

Effectiveness of candidate reserves was assessed by how productivity values differed from the initial conditions (2000\textendash{}2005 baseline). Results indicate that small reserves ($<$1000 km2) at high elevations, high latitudes, intermittent environments (wetlands) or dominated by open shrub experienced the greatest amount of inter-annual variability. Alternately, larger reserves ($\geq$1000 km2; $<$10000 km2) were stable under these same conditions. Results also indicate that reserves located in highly productive areas ($>$700 kgC m-2 yr-1) experienced greater inter-annual variability than low productivity areas. This approach provides an objective and consistent means of evaluating reserve efficacy across different geographic areas and through time.

A key part of this effort is a move towards open data as a way to fight post-publication data loss, improve data and code quality, enable powerful meta- and cross-disciplinary analyses, and increase trust in, and the efficiency of, publicly-funded research. Many scientists however lack experience in, and may be unsure of the benefits of, making their data and fully-reproducible analyses publicly available. Here we describe a recent `open experiment', in which we documented every aspect of a soil incubation online, making all raw data, scripts, diagnostics, final analyses, and manuscripts available in real time. We found that using tools such as version control, issue tracking, and open-source statistical software improved data integrity, accelerated our team's communication and productivity, and ensured transparency. There are many avenues to improve scientific reproducibility and data availability, of which is this only one example, and it is not an approach suited for every experiment or situation. Nonetheless, we encourage the communities in our respective fields to consider its advantages, and to lead rather than follow with respect to scientific reproducibility, transparency, and data availability.},

This enables scientists to measure global and climate changes and to inform decisions by government, other organizations, and people in the United States and around the world. The data collected and results generated are accessible to other agencies and organizations to improve the products and services they provide, including air quality indices, disaster prediction and response, agricultural yield projections, and aviation safety. ESD's Flight Program provides the space based observing systems and infrastructure for mission operations and scientific data processing and distribution that support NASA's Earth science research and modeling activities. The Flight Program currently has 21 operating Earth observing space missions, including the recently launched Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2), the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission, and the International Space Station (ISS) RapidSCAT and Cloud-Aerosol Transport System (CATS) instruments. The ESD has 22 more missions and instruments planned for launch over the next decade. These include first and second tier missions from the 2007 Earth Science Decadal Survey, Climate Continuity missions and selected instruments to assure availability of key climate data sets, operational missions to ensure sustained land imaging provided by the Landsat system, and small-sized competitively selected orbital missions and instrument missions of opportunity belonging to the Earth Venture (EV) Program.

  doi = {10.1890/07-1134.1},
  abstract = {Community assembly processes are thought to shape the mean, spread, and spacing of functional trait values within communities. Two broad categories of assembly processes have been proposed: first, a habitat filter that restricts the range of viable strategies and second, a partitioning of microsites and/or resources that leads to a limit to the similarity of coexisting species. The strength of both processes may be dependent on conditions at a particular site and may change along an abiotic gradient. We sampled environmental variables and plant communities in 44 plots across the varied topography of a coastal California landscape. We characterized 14 leaf, stem, and root traits for 54 woody plant species, including detailed intraspecific data for two traits with the goal of understanding the connection between traits and assembly processes in a variety of environmental conditions. We examined the within-community mean, range, variance, kurtosis, and other measures of spacing of trait values. In this landscape, there was a topographically mediated gradient in water availability. Across this gradient we observed strong shifts in both the plot-level mean trait values and the variation in trait values within communities. Trends in trait means with the environment were due largely to species turnover, with intraspecific shifts playing a smaller role. Traits associated with a vertical partitioning of light showed a greater range and variance on the wet soils, while nitrogen per area, which is associated with water use efficiency, showed a greater spread on the dry soils. We found strong nonrandom patterns in the trait distributions consistent with expectations based on trait-mediated community assembly. There was a significant reduction in the range of six out of 11 leaf and stem functional trait values relative to a null model. For specific leaf area (SLA) we found a significant even spacing of trait values relative to the null model. For seed size we found a more platykurtic distribution than expected. These results suggest that both a habitat filter and a limit to the similarity of coexisting species can simultaneously shape the distribution of traits and the assembly of local plant communities.},

  abstract = {* The leaf economics spectrum (LES) has been an organizing framework of plant functional ecology for the past decade. The LES describes a set of trade-offs among traits related to plant carbon balance. Species with a long leaf life span (LLS) invest additional material for leaf protection and structural support and consequently tend to have a lower leaf photosynthetic rate per unit mass than species with a shorter LLS.

* While the LES is most apparent in comparing species with extreme differences in their traits, it has nonetheless been adopted as a general explanation of leaf trait variation at all scales and in all plants. It highlights the `trait-based' approach to plant ecology, which has generally used a small set of traits to predict whole organism and even whole ecosystem attributes. Few studies have investigated the relationships between LES traits and organismal attributes not directly related to carbon economy.

* We explored the LES in 32 deciduous woody species of Viburnum (Adoxaceae). We found no evidence for any mass-based LES trade-offs. Rather, on an area basis, photosynthetic rates were positively correlated with leaf mass per area (LMA); higher LMA was associated with greater investment in photosynthetic tissue, with most of the variation due to changes in the thickness of photosynthetic mesophyll.

* Species' mean LLS varied between 19 and 26~weeks and was not correlated with other LES traits. Instead, LLS was strongly associated with the diverse set of whole-plant branching patterns in Viburnum. In the most common growth pattern, LLS was significantly correlated with flowering time, because branches end in terminal inflorescences, and all leaves and inflorescences are pre-formed in overwintering buds.

* Synthesis. Plants may recover the cost of their leaves early in the growing season, allowing LLS to vary independently of the plant carbon budget. In deciduous species, LLS may be strongly influenced by whole plant architecture, which, in Viburnum, is evolutionarily conserved. In general, positive area-based LES trait relationships will limit the relevance of LLS to this spectrum and allow LLS to vary for reasons that are not directly related to carbon economy.},

The growth of interest in biodiversity variables observable from space has been partly underpinned by the development of the essential biodiversity variable (EBV) framework by the Group on Earth Observations \textendash{} Biodiversity Observation Network, which itself was guided by the process of identifying essential climate variables. This contribution aims to advance the development of a global biodiversity monitoring strategy by updating the previously published definition of EBV, providing a definition of satellite remote sensing (SRS) EBVs and introducing a set of principles that are believed to be necessary if ecologists and space agencies are to agree on a list of EBVs that can be routinely monitored from space. Progress toward the identification of SRS-EBVs will require a clear understanding of what makes a biodiversity variable essential, as well as agreement on who the users of the SRS-EBVs are. Technological and algorithmic developments are rapidly expanding the set of opportunities for SRS in monitoring biodiversity, and so the list of SRS-EBVs is likely to evolve over time. This means that a clear and common platform for data providers, ecologists, environmental managers, policy makers and remote sensing experts to interact and share ideas needs to be identified to support long-term coordinated actions.},

BACKGROUNDAs global climate change accelerates, one of the most urgent tasks for the coming decades is to develop accurate predictions about biological responses to guide the effective protection of biodiversity. Predictive models in biology provide a means for scientists to project changes to species and ecosystems in response to disturbances such as climate change. Most current predictive models, however, exclude important biological mechanisms such as demography, dispersal, evolution, and species interactions. These biological mechanisms have been shown to be important in mediating past and present responses to climate change. Thus, current modeling efforts do not provide sufficiently accurate predictions. Despite the many complexities involved, biologists are rapidly developing tools that include the key biological processes needed to improve predictive accuracy. The biggest obstacle to applying these more realistic models is that the data needed to inform them are almost always missing. We suggest ways to fill this growing gap between model sophistication and information to predict and prevent the most damaging aspects of climate change for life on Earth.
ADVANCESOn the basis of empirical and theoretical evidence, we identify six biological mechanisms that commonly shape responses to climate change yet are too often missing from current predictive models: physiology; demography, life history, and phenology; species interactions; evolutionary potential and population differentiation; dispersal, colonization, and range dynamics; and responses to environmental variation. We prioritize the types of information needed to inform each of these mechanisms and suggest proxies for data that are missing or difficult to collect. We show that even for well-studied species, we often lack critical information that would be necessary to apply more realistic, mechanistic models. Consequently, data limitations likely override the potential gains in accuracy of more realistic models. Given the enormous challenge of collecting this detailed information on millions of species around the world, we highlight practical methods that promote the greatest gains in predictive accuracy. Trait-based approaches leverage sparse data to make more general inferences about unstudied species. Targeting species with high climate sensitivity and disproportionate ecological impact can yield important insights about future ecosystem change. Adaptive modeling schemes provide a means to target the most important data while simultaneously improving predictive accuracy.
OUTLOOKStrategic collections of essential biological information will allow us to build generalizable insights that inform our broader ability to anticipate species' responses to climate change and other human-caused disturbances. By increasing accuracy and making uncertainties explicit, scientists can deliver improved projections for biodiversity under climate change together with characterizations of uncertainty to support more informed decisions by policymakers and land managers. Toward this end, a globally coordinated effort to fill data gaps in advance of the growing climate-fueled biodiversity crisis offers substantial advantages in efficiency, coverage, and accuracy. Biologists can take advantage of the lessons learned from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's development, coordination, and integration of climate change projections. Climate and weather projections were greatly improved by incorporating important mechanisms and testing predictions against global weather station data. Biology can do the same. We need to adopt this meteorological approach to predicting biological responses to climate change to enhance our ability to mitigate future changes to global biodiversity and the services it provides to humans. $<$img class="fragment-image" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/353/6304/aad8466/F1.medium.gif"/$>$ Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Emerging models are beginning to incorporate six key biological mechanisms that can improve predictions of biological responses to climate change.Models that include biological mechanisms have been used to project (clockwise from top) the evolution of disease-harboring mosquitoes, future environments and land use, physiological responses of invasive species such as cane toads, demographic responses of penguins to future climates, climate-dependent dispersal behavior in butterflies, and mismatched interactions between butterflies and their host plants. Despite these modeling advances, we seldom have the detailed data needed to build these models, necessitating new efforts to collect the relevant data to parameterize more biologically realistic predictive models.
New biological models are incorporating the realistic processes underlying biological responses to climate change and other human-caused disturbances. However, these more realistic models require detailed information, which is lacking for most species on Earth. Current monitoring efforts mainly document changes in biodiversity, rather than collecting the mechanistic data needed to predict future changes. We describe and prioritize the biological information needed to inform more realistic projections of species' responses to climate change. We also highlight how trait-based approaches and adaptive modeling can leverage sparse data to make broader predictions. We outline a global effort to collect the data necessary to better understand, anticipate, and reduce the damaging effects of climate change on biodiversity.},

  abstract = {Spatially distributed chlorophyll content of urban vegetation provides an important indicator of a plant's health status, which might depend on the habitat quality of the specific urban environment. Recent advances in optical remote sensing led to improved methodologies to monitor vegetation properties. The hyperspectral index NAOC (Normalized Area Over reflectance Curve) is one of these new tools that can be used for mapping chlorophyll content. In this paper we present the work done to quantify vegetation chlorophyll content over the city of Valencia (Spain) based on chlorophyll measurements of four representative tree species: the London plane tree (Platanus x. acerifolia), the Canarian date palm (Phoenix canariensis), the European nettle tree (Celtis australis) and the white mulberry (Morus alba). Measurements were acquired during the summer of 2011, in a field campaign in which for 320 leaf samples, chlorophyll content was measured both in the laboratory and by using a SPAD-502 chlorophyll meter. Both methods were correlated (R2 \&gt; 0.86), using best fit power type functions. During the field campaign an aircraft with a CASI (Compact Airborne Spectral Imager) hyperspectral sensor onboard overflew the city obtaining imagery with a spatial resolution of $\sim$1 m suitable to identify individual urban trees. From the CASI data the NAOC index was calculated and linked with the laboratory chlorophyll content measurements. This led to a detailed chlorophyll content map with a RMSE of 15 $\mu$g cm-2. Chlorophyll map analysis at the individual crown level suggests the applicability to identify trees with lowered chlorophyll content due to a suboptimal habitat quality.},

  doi = {10.1111/jvs.12421},
  abstract = {Questions

Pollination is an ecosystem function that varies at local spatial scales. Remote sensing may help to quantify and map the resulting patterns for a better understanding of ecosystem functioning. This task is challenging because the signal measured by sensors is dominated by leaf and canopy optical traits that determine the vegetation spectrum. No direct influence of pollination types (i.e. wind, insect and self-pollination) can be expected. We thus ask: (1) how strongly are pollination types at the community level linked with optical traits; and (2) do these links allow us to map spatial patterns of pollination types with remote sensing data?

Location

Mires and Molinia grasslands in Bavaria, southern Germany.

Methods

We sampled vascular plant species composition, as well as traits related to optical spectral signals, for 100 plots. Information on pollination types and additional optical traits were compiled from established plant trait databases. Simultaneously with the field sampling, image data of the study site were acquired using the airborne sensor AISA Dual. We tested for correlations between pollination types and optical traits. Based on these results, we regressed the plot-based information on pollination types against the corresponding spectral signal extracted from the image data. We inverted the models using the image in order to obtain maps of the pollination type distribution across the study site.

Results

In our study site, pollination types and optical traits were significantly correlated, up to R~=~-0.813 in the case of wind pollination and leaf dry matter content. These relations are, however, not necessarily transferable to other ecosystems, phenological stages and spatial scales, and their physical interpretation requires careful consideration. We were able to statistically model the spatial distribution of pollination types with a RMSE~$<$~10.5\%. The resulting maps provide detailed insights into the spatial distribution of pollination types at the community level.

Conclusions

The results show that pollination types are indeed related to canopy reflectance in a way that allows their mapping using remote sensing. More research is needed in order to improve our knowledge about transferable relations between pollination types and plant traits in other ecosystems and at different phenological stages.},

  abstract = {A hybrid inversion method was developed to estimate the leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) of crops. Fifty hyperspectral vegetation indices (VIs), such as the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) and canopy chlorophyll index (CCI), were compared to identify the appropriate VIs for crop LCC and CCC inversion. The hybrid inversion models were then generated from different modelling methods, including the curve-fitting and least squares support vector regression (LS-SVR) and random forest regression (RFR) algorithms, by using simulated Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (CHRIS) datasets that were generated by a radiative transfer model. Finally, the remote-sensing mapping of a CHRIS image was completed to test the inversion accuracy. The results showed that the remote-sensing mapping of the CHRIS image yielded an accuracy of R2 = 0.77 and normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) = 17.34\% for the CCC inversion, and an accuracy of only R2 = 0.33 and NRMSE = 26.03\% for LCC inversion, which indicates that the remote-sensing technique was more appropriate for obtaining chlorophyll content at the canopy scale (CCC) than at the leaf scale (LCC). The estimated results of various VIs and algorithms suggested that the PRI and CCI were the optimal VIs for LCC and CCC inversion, respectively, and RFR was the optimal method for modelling.},

  abstract = {* Climate models predict increasing drought intensity and frequency for many regions, which may have negative consequences for tree recruitment, growth, and mortality, as well as forest ecosystem services. Furthermore, practical strategies for minimizing vulnerability to drought are limited. Tree population density, a metric of tree abundance in a given area, is a primary driver of competitive intensity among trees, which influences tree growth and mortality. Manipulating tree population density may be a mechanism for moderating drought-induced stress and growth reductions, although the relationship between tree population density and tree drought vulnerability remains poorly quantified, especially across climatic gradients.

* In this study, we examined three long-term forest ecosystem experiments in two widely-distributed North American pine species, ponderosa pine Pinus ponderosa (Lawson \& C. Lawson) and red pine Pinus resinosa (Aiton), to better elucidate the relationship between tree population density, growth, and drought. These experiments span a broad latitude and aridity range and include tree population density treatments that have been purposefully maintained for several decades. We investigated how tree population density influenced resistance (growth during drought) and resilience (growth after drought compared to pre-drought growth) of stand-level growth during and after documented drought events.

* Our results show that relative tree population density was negatively related to drought resistance and resilience, indicating that trees growing at lower densities were less vulnerable to drought. This result was apparent in all three forest ecosystems, and was consistent across species, stand age, and drought intensity.

* Synthesis and applications. Our results highlighted that managing pine forest ecosystems at low tree population density represents a promising adaptive strategy for reducing the adverse impacts of drought on forest growth in coming decades. Nonetheless, the broader applicability of our findings to other types of forest ecosystems merits additional investigation.

Existing survey approaches cannot provide sufficiently fine-resolution data at landscape-level extents to quantify this structure appropriately. Using a small, unpiloted aerial system (UAS) to acquire aerial photographs and processing theses using structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry, three-dimensional models were produced describing the vegetation structure of semi-arid ecosystems at seven sites across a grass\textendash{}to shrub transition zone. This approach yielded ultra-fine (\&lt; 1 cm2) spatial resolution canopy height models over landscape-levels (10 ha), which resolved individual grass tussocks just a few cm3 in volume. Canopy height cumulative distributions for each site illustrated ecologically-significant differences in ecosystem structure. Strong coefficients of determination (r2 from 0.64 to 0.95) supported prediction of above-ground biomass from canopy volume. Canopy volumes, above-ground biomass and carbon stocks were shown to be sensitive to spatial changes in the structure of vegetation communities. The grain of data produced and sensitivity of this approach is invaluable to capture even subtle differences in the structure (and therefore function) of these heterogeneous ecosystems subject to rapid environmental change. The results demonstrate how products from inexpensive UAS coupled with SfM photogrammetry can produce ultra-fine grain biophysical data products, which have the potential to revolutionise scientific understanding of ecology in ecosystems with either spatially or temporally discontinuous canopy cover.},

  issn = {1466-8238},
  doi = {10.1111/geb.12306},
  abstract = {Aim

Understanding the factors that govern species' geographical ranges is of utmost importance for predicting potential range shifts triggered by environmental change. Species ranges are partially limited by their tolerances to extrinsic environmental conditions such as climate and habitat. However, they are also determined by the capacity of species to disperse, establish new populations and proliferate, which are in turn dependent on species intrinsic life-history traits. So far, the contribution of intrinsic factors driving species distributions has been inconclusive, largely because intrinsic and extrinsic factors have not been examined simultaneously in a satisfactory way. We investigate how geographical ranges of plants are determined by both extrinsic environmental factors and species intrinsic life-history traits.

Location

Europe.

Methods

We compiled a database on plant geographical ranges, environmental tolerances and life-history traits that constitutes the largest dataset analysed to date (1276 species). We used generalized linear modelling to test if range size and range filling (the proportion of climatically suitable area a species occupies) are affected by dispersal distance, habitat breadth and 10 life-history traits related to establishment and proliferation.

Results

The species characteristics that were most linked to range limitations of European plant species were dispersal potential, seed bank persistence and habitat breadth (which together explained $\geq$\,30\% of deviance in range filling and range size). Specific leaf area, which has been linked to establishment ability, made a smaller contribution to native range limitations.

Main conclusions

Our results can be used to improve estimates of extinction vulnerability under climate change. Species with high dispersal capacity, that can maintain viable seed banks for several years and that can live in an intermediate number of habitats have the fewest non-climatic limitations on their ranges, and are most likely to shift their geographical ranges under climate change. We suggest that climate-change risk assessments should not focus exclusively on dispersal capacity.},

However, variation in canopy structure affects our ability to estimate foliar properties from airborne spectrometer data, yet these structural affects remain poorly quantified. Using leaf spectral (400\textendash{}2500~nm) and chemical data collected from 162 Australian tropical forest species, along with partial least squares (PLS) analysis and canopy radiative transfer modeling, we determined the strength of the relationship between canopy reflectance and foliar properties under conditions of varying canopy structure.

At the leaf level, chlorophylls, carotenoids and specific leaf area (SLA) were highly correlated with leaf spectral reflectance (r = 0.90\textendash{}0.91). Foliar nutrients and water were also well represented by the leaf spectra (r = 0.79\textendash{}0.85). When the leaf spectra were incorporated into the canopy radiative transfer simulations with an idealistic leaf area index (LAI) = 5.0, correlations between canopy reflectance spectra and leaf properties increased in strength by 4\textendash{}18\%. The effects of random LAI (= 3.0\textendash{}6.5) variation on the retrieval of leaf properties remained minimal, particularly for pigments and SLA (r = 0.92\textendash{}0.93). In contrast, correlations between leaf nitrogen (N) and canopy reflectance estimates decreased from r = 0.87 at constant LAI = 5 to r = 0.65 with randomly varying LAI = 3.0\textendash{}6.5. Progressive increases in the structural variability among simulated tree crowns had relatively little effect on pigment, SLA and water predictions. However, N and phosphorus (P) were more sensitive to canopy structural variability. Our modeling results suggest that multiple leaf chemicals and SLA can be estimated from leaf and canopy reflectance spectroscopy, and that the high-LAI canopies found in tropical forests enhance the signal via multiple scattering. Finally, the two factors we found to most negatively impact leaf chemical predictions from canopy reflectance were variation in LAI and viewing geometry, which can be managed with new airborne technologies and analytical methods.},

  doi = {10.1007/s11120-016-0276-4},
  abstract = {Leaf development is influenced by almost all the prevailing environmental conditions as well as from the conditions at the time of bud formation. Furthermore, the growth form of a plant determines the leaf longevity and subsequently the investment in biomass and the internal structure of the mesophyll. Therefore, photosynthetic traits of a growing leaf, though, partly predetermined, should also acclimate to temporal changes during developmental period. In addition, the age of the plant can affect photosynthesis of the growing leaf, yet, in the majority of studies, the age is associated to the size of the plant. To test if the reproductive status of the plant affects the time kinetics of the photosynthetic capacity of a growing leaf and the relative contribution of the plants' growth form to the whole procedure, field measurements were conducted in juveniles (prereproductive individuals) and adults (fully reproductive individuals) of an evergreen sclerophyllous shrub (Nerium oleander), a semi-deciduous dimorphic shrub (Phlomis fruticosa), and a winter deciduous tree with pre-leafing flowering (Cercis siliquastrum). PSII structural and functional integrity was progressively developed in all species, but already completed, only some days after leaf expansion in P. fruticosa. Developing leaf as well as fully developed leaf in adults of C. siliquastrum showed enhanced relative size of the pool of final PSI electron acceptors. Photosynthetic traits between juveniles and adults of P. fruticosa were similar, though the matured leaf of adults exhibited lower transpiration rates and improved water-use efficiency than that of juveniles. Adults of the evergreen shrub attained higher CO2 assimilation rate than juveniles in matured leaf which can be attributed to higher electron flow devoted to carboxylation, and lower photorespiration rate. The reproductive phase of the plant seemed to be involved in modifications of the PSII and PSI functions of the deciduous tree, in carboxylation and photorespiration traits of the evergreen shrub, and in water conductance efficiency of the semi-deciduous shrub. However, it is interesting, that regardless of the growth form of the plant and the prospective leaf longevity of the developing leaf, adults need to support flowering outmatch juveniles, in terms of photosynthesis.},

  abstract = {Metabolism in plants is compartmentalized among different tissues, cells and subcellular organelles. Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) has recently advanced to allow for the visualization of metabolites at single cell resolution. Here we applied 5 and 10 $\mu$m high-spatial resolution MALDI-MSI to the asymmetric Kranz anatomy of maize leaves to study the differential localization of two major anionic lipids in thylakoid membranes, sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerols (SQDG) and phosphatidylglycerols (PG). The quantification and localization of SQDG and PG molecular species, among mesophyll (M) and bundle sheath (BS) cells, are compared across the leaf developmental gradient from four maize genotypes (the inbreds B73 and Mo17, and reciprocal hybrids B73xMo17 and Mo17xB73). SQDG species are uniformly distributed in both photosynthetic cell types regardless of leaf development or genotype. However, PG shows photosynthetic cell-specific differential localization depending on the genotype and the fatty acyl chain constituent. Overall, 16:1-containing PGs primarily contribute to the thylakoid membranes of M cells while BS chloroplasts are mostly composed of 16:0-containing PGs. Furthermore, PG 32:0 shows genotype-specific differences in cellular distribution, with preferential localization in BS cells for B73, but more uniform distribution between BS and M cells in Mo17. Maternal inheritance is exhibited within the hybrids such that localization of PG 32:0 in B73xMo17 is similar to the distribution in the B73 parental inbred, whereas that of Mo17xB73 resembles the Mo17 parent. This study demonstrates the power of MALDI-MSI to reveal unprecedented insights on metabolic outcomes in multicellular organisms at single cell resolution. This article is protected by copyright.

  abstract = {Plant species can be classified into heterobaric and homobaric, depending on whether their leaves present bundle sheath extensions (BSEs) (heterobaric) or not (homobaric). Incidences of the two leaf types seem to be related to growth environment and the light stratification. The Brazilian Cerrado and seasonal semideciduous forests are contrasting environments mainly with regard to irradiance and air humidity. However, studies comparing the distributions of homobaric and heterobaric species in these vegetation types are lacking. We investigate the presence/absence of leaf BSEs across diverse habits (herbs, shrubs and trees) in a seasonal semideciduous forest, cerrado sensu stricto (open physiognomy) and cerrad{\~a}o (forest physiognomy) to evaluate the influence of plant habit and growth environment on the distribution of homobaric and heterobaric species. Leaves from 131 species in 54 angiosperm families were analysed using standard methods of light microscopy. The distribution of the different leaf types in each environment was analysed using the $\chi$2 test and Fisher's exact test (P \&lt; 0.05). Homobaric and heterobaric leafed species occur in all environments and do not correlate with plant habit. Of the total number of species examined, 103 (78.6\%) exhibited homobaric leaves and 28 (21.4\%) presented heterobaric leaves. Of the total of heterobaric species, 8.8\% occurred in the seasonal semideciduous forest, 50\% in the cerrad{\~a}o and 41.2\% in the cerrado sensu stricto. This model of distribution may be related to the higher irradiances in Cerrado. Homobaric leaves of shrubs and trees were thicker in all environments, while heterobaric leaves of herbs were thicker in the Cerrado. This study finds a tendency for the distribution pattern of homobaric or heterobaric leaves to reflect both the growth environment and the taxonomic grouping. Since leaf type is a constitutive characteristic, interspecific differences in leaf type may reflect particular physiological behaviours, linking them to success in colonising particular environments.},

  doi = {10.1093/treephys/tpw075},
  abstract = {Environmental heterogeneity and plant\textendash{}plant interactions are key factors shaping plant communities. However, the spatial dimension of plant\textendash{}plant interactions has seldom been addressed in field studies. This is at least partially rooted in a lack of methods that can accurately resolve functional processes in a spatially explicit manner. Isoscapes, that is, spatially explicit representations of stable isotope data, provide a versatile means to trace functional changes on spatial scales, for example, related to N-cycling (foliar $\delta$15N) and water use efficiency (WUEi, foliar $\delta$13C). In a case study in a nutrient-depleted Mediterranean dune ecosystem, we analysed the spatial impact of the invasive N2-fixing Acacia longifolia on three native species of different functional types using $\delta$15N and $\delta$13C isoscapes and spatial autocorrelation analyses. Isoscapes revealed strong spatial patterns in $\delta$15N and $\delta$13C with pronounced species-specific differences, demonstrating distinct spatial ranges of plant\textendash{}plant interactions. A coniferous tree and an ericaceous dwarf shrub showed significant enrichment in $\delta$15N within a range of 5\textendash{}8 m surrounding the canopy of A. longifolia, indicating input of N originating from symbiotic N2-fixation by the invader. In the dwarf shrub, which was most responsive to invader influence, enrichment in $\delta$13C additionally demonstrated spatially explicit changes to WUEi, while a native N2-fixer was unresponsive to the presence of the invader. Furthermore, $\delta$15N and $\delta$13C isoscapes yielded different patterns, indicating that plant\textendash{}plant interactions can have distinct spatial distributions and ranges based on the process measured. Additionally, the magnitude of the effect differed between field situations with high and low invasion pressure. This study highlights that the spatial scale must be accounted for when assessing the effects and outcome of species interactions. Functional tracers such as stable isotopes enable us to quantify spatial ranges of plant\textendash{}plant interactions, providing empirical data that can help to better understand and predict complex species interactions in multifaceted natural environments.},

The objective of this chapter is to analyze paradigms of photosynthetic performance and life history traits of tropical forest trees to contrasting light environments across the forest floor, gaps and upper canopy. Physiological and morphological plasticity as well as genetically fixed adaptive traits are analyzed, including leaf optical properties and photoprotection from high irradiance. Photosynthetic adaptations to contrasting light environments of closely related species are discussed. This approach has the advantage among comparative studies of adaptations across species in that genetic relationships among species are known. Species-specific variations in maximum photosynthetic rates, which reflect the degree of adaptation to growth irradiance, are shown to be gradual, suggesting that classification into two distinct functional groups in terms of light requirements is somewhat arbitrary. Trees growing in gaps or in the upper canopy rely strongly on biochemical mechanisms to dissipate excess energy and to avoid damage to the light reaction centers and photosystems. Consistent with their high photosynthetic capacity, light demanding species are capable of plastic changes in hydraulic architecture , such as increases in hydraulic conductivity under high irradiance, which makes them more competitive in open habitats.},

  abstract = {Leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and specific leaf area (SLA) are two important traits in measuring biodiversity. To use remote sensing for the estimation of these traits, it is essential to understand the underlying factors that influence their relationships with canopy reflectance. The effect of canopy structures-particularly stem density (SD), leaf area index (LAI), stand height (SH), crown diameter (CD), and average leaf angle (ALA)-on the relationship between LDMC and SLA with the canopy reflectance were investigated using a canopy reflectance dataset simulated by the invertible forest reflectance model (INFORM) radiative transfer model. The parameterization of the model was based on the range of the field parameters collected in the Bavarian National Park in July 2013 and the configuration of the HYSpex hyperspectral sensor. Strong correlations were observed between the two leaf traits and indices derived from simulated canopy spectra in the NIR and SWIR region (R2 values of 0.87 for LDMC and 0.85 for SLA). Among the tested HYSpex wavelengths, the bands most sensitive to variation were 2298.69 nm for LDMC and 2280.71 nm for SLA. The effects of the stated structural variables on the relationships were best controlled by the modified normalized difference (mND) vegetation index (VI): ([R2275 - R1920]/[R2275 + R1920 - 2 * R1520]). The structural variables that most affected the relationship were forest SD and CD. The modeling results suggest that the spectral variation due to changes in LDMC and SLA is best captured for stands with SD $>$ 400 trees/ha and CD $\geq$ 5 m. The influence of LAI and SH on the relationships can be greatly reduced using VIs. We conclude that LDMC and SLA can be accurately estimated from canopy reflectance, irrespective of the heterogeneity of structural variables, providing that canopy cover exceeds 50\%.},

After screening sensitive vegetation index with in-situ samples by correlation analysis, the study developed the inversion model by single variable and multiple variables. The determination coefficient (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE) was used to evaluate the accuracy of models. Results showed that the accuracies of multivariable models were better than these of single-variable models, of which the average R2 reached 0.647 and the average RMSE was 0.059. It indicated that the multi-variable models were input in more information than those of single-variable models, which improved the accuracies of estimating paddy biomass in to a certain degree. The average overall accuracies of multi-variable models were 92.7\%, while that of singe-variable models were 87.8\%.

  abstract = {Spatially explicit information on tree species composition of managed and natural forests, plantations and urban vegetation provides valuable information for nature conservationists as well as for forest and urban managers and is frequently required over large spatial extents. Over the last four decades, advances in remote sensing technology have enabled the classification of tree species from several sensor types.

While studies using remote sensing data to classify and map tree species reach back several decades, a recent review on the status, potentials, challenges and outlooks in this realm is missing. Here, we search for major trends in remote sensing techniques for tree species classification and discuss the effectiveness of different sensors and algorithms based on a literature review.

This review demonstrates that the number of studies focusing on tree species classification has increased constantly over the last four decades and promising local scale approaches have been presented for several sensor types. However, there are few examples for tree species classifications over large geographic extents, and bridging the gap between current approaches and tree species inventories over large geographic extents is still one of the biggest challenges of this research field. Furthermore, we found only few studies which systematically described and examined the traits that drive the observed variance in the remote sensing signal and thereby enable or hamper species classifications. Most studies followed data-driven approaches and pursued an optimization of classification accuracy, while a concrete hypothesis or a targeted application was missing in all but a few exceptional studies.

We recommend that future research efforts focus stronger on the causal understanding of why tree species classification approaches work under certain conditions or \textendash{} maybe even more important - why they do not work in other cases. This might require more complex field acquisitions than those typically used in the reviewed studies. At the same time, we recommend reducing the number of purely data-driven studies and algorithm-benchmarking studies as these studies are of limited value, especially if the experimental design is limited, e.g. the tree population is not representative and only a few sensors or acquisition settings are simultaneously investigated.},

We explore the relationship between species and functional diversity of herbaceous and shrubby plant communities in forested and deforested habitats in three Neotropical landscapes. We focus on six traits: pollination mechanism, dispersal mechanism, growth form, fruit type, fruit size, and seed size. We ask: (1) What is the relationship between species richness and functional diversity (trait state richness)? (2) Do species/functional diversity relationships differ between forested and deforested habitats? and (3) Are observed species/functional diversity patterns more consistent with ecological filtering or differentiation-based assembly processes? We show that species richness is often a weak surrogate for functional diversity, depending on the trait. Species/functional diversity relationships differ significantly between forested and deforested habitats, but the nature of differences is trait dependent. Dispersal mechanism and fruit type number increased more rapidly in deforested than forested habitats, but the opposite was true for most other traits. Using a null model, we found evidence of ecological filtering for most traits in both habitats. Results demonstrate that deforested habitats do not necessarily contain lower functional diversity than forest but that the ecological assembly processes influencing community function in deforested communities differ dramatically from forest.},

Annually the increase was c. 17~W~m-2. Larger increases occurred where initial canopy cover was greater or at higher elevations, by as much as c. 80~W~m-2 (a 40\% increase). 5.\hspace{0.6em}Synthesis. Our results are notable in that they quantify increases regionally in near-ground solar radiation in response to a climate extreme triggering widespread tree die-off. The substantial increases quantified are expected to have primary direct effects on processes such as plant physiology, reproduction, phenology, soil evaporation and nutrient cycling, and secondary effects on understory facilitation, productivity and diversity, and land surface\textendash{}atmosphere fluxes of energy, carbon and water. Consequently, extreme event-induced changes in near-ground solar radiation need to be considered by both ecologists and physical scientists in assessing global change impacts. More generally, our results highlight an important but sometimes overlooked aspect of plant ecology \textendash{} that plants not only respond to their physical environment and other plants, but also directly modify their physical environment from individual plant to regional scales.},

  abstract = {Grasslands play important roles in ecosystem production and support a large farming and grazing industry. An accurate and efficient way is needed to estimate grassland health and production for monitoring and adjusting management to get sustainable products and other ecosystem services. Previous studies of grasslands have shown varying relationships between productivity and biodiversity, with most showing either a positive or a hump-shaped relationship where productivity peaks at intermediate diversity. In this study, we used airborne imaging spectrometry combined with ground sampling and eddy covariance measurements to estimate the spatial pattern of production and biodiversity for two sites of contrasting productivity in a southern Alberta prairie ecosystem. Resulting patterns revealed that more diverse sites generally had greater productivity, supporting the hypothesis of a positive relationship between production and biodiversity for this site. We showed that the addition of evenness to richness (using the Shannon Index of dominant species instead of the number of dominant species alone) improved the correlation with optical diversity, an optically derived metric of biodiversity based on the coefficient of variation in spectral reflectance across space.~ Similarly, the Shannon Index was better correlated with productivity (estimated via NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)) than the number of dominant species alone. Optical diversity provided a potent proxy for other more traditional biodiversity metrics (richness and Shannon index). Coupling field measurements and imaging spectrometry provides a method for assessing grassland productivity and biodiversity at a larger scale than can be sampled from the ground, and allows the integrated analysis of the productivity\textendash{}biodiversity relationship over large areas.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.01.049},
  abstract = {Species-based ecological indices, such as Ellenberg indicators, reflect plant habitat preferences and can be used to describe local environment conditions. One disadvantage of using vegetation data as a substitute for environmental data is the fact that extensive floristic sampling can usually only be carried out at a plot scale within limited geographical areas. Remotely sensed data have the potential to provide information on fine-scale vegetation properties over large areas. In the present study, we examine whether airborne hyperspectral remote sensing can be used to predict Ellenberg nutrient (N) and moisture (M) values in plots in dry grazed grasslands within a local agricultural landscape in southern Sweden. We compare the prediction accuracy of three categories of model: (I) models based on predefined vegetation indices (VIs), (II) models based on waveband-selected VIs, and (III) models based on the full set of hyperspectral wavebands. We also identify the optimal combination of wavebands for the prediction of Ellenberg values. The floristic composition of 104 (4 m \texttimes{} 4 m grassland) plots on the Baltic island of {\"O}land was surveyed in the field, and the vascular plant species recorded in the plots were assigned Ellenberg indicator values for N and M. A community-weighted mean value was calculated for N (mN) and M (mM) within each plot. Hyperspectral data were extracted from an 8 m \texttimes{} 8 m pixel window centred on each plot. The relationship between field-observed and predicted mean Ellenberg values was significant for all three categories of prediction models. The performance of the category II and III models was comparable, and they gave lower prediction errors and higher R2 values than the category I models for both mN and mM. Visible and near-infrared wavebands were important for the prediction of both mN and mM, and shortwave infrared wavebands were also important for the prediction of mM. We conclude that airborne hyperspectral remote sensing can detect spectral differences in vegetation between grassland plots characterised by different mean Ellenberg N and M values, and that remote sensing technology can potentially be used to survey fine-scale variation in environmental conditions within a local agricultural landscape.},

Rapid, objective, and repeatable methods are needed to measure these vegetative parameters to advance our understanding and modeling of plant ecophysiological processes. Terrestrial laser scanners (TLS) can be used to measure structural and potentially chemical properties of objects by quantifying the x,y,z coordinates and intensity of laser light, respectively, returned from an object's surface. The objective of this study was to determine the potential usefulness of TLS with a green (532 nm) laser to simultaneously measure the spatial distribution of chlorophyll a and b content (Chlab), leaf area (LA), and leaf angle (LAN). The TLS measurements were obtained from saplings of two tree species (Quercus macrocarpa and Acer saccharum) and from an angle-adjustable cardboard surface. The green laser return intensity value was strongly correlated with wet-chemically determined Chlab (r2 = 0.77). Strong agreement was shown between measured and TLS-derived LA (r2 = 0.95, intercept = - 1.43, slope = 0.97). The TLS derived LANs of both species followed a plagiophile LAN distribution, and the measured angles of the cardboard surface allowed us to quantify that these LAN values were strongly correlated with TLS derived angles (r2 = 1.0, intercept and slope = 0.98). Our results show that terrestrial laser scanners are feasible for simultaneous measurement of LA, LAN, and Chlab in simple canopies of small broadleaved plants. Further research is needed in more complex and larger canopies.},

The experimental design was a complete random block design that consisted of four replicate blocks, with each block containing a 15~m \texttimes{} 15~m control and heated plot. Black spruce [Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP] was the overstory species and Epilobium angustifolium was the dominant understory. Soil temperature was maintained ($\sim$5~$^\circ$C) above the control soil temperature using electric cables inside water filled polyethylene tubing for each heated plot. Air inside a 7.3-m-diameter chamber, centered in the soil warming plot, contained approximately nine black spruce trees was heated $\sim$5~$^\circ$C above control ambient air temperature allowing for the testing of soil-only warming and soil+air warming. Soil surface CO2 flux (RS) was positively correlated (P $<$ 0.0001) to soil temperature at 10~cm depth. Soil surface CO2 flux (RS) was 24\% greater in the soil-only warming than the control in 2004, but was only 11\% greater in 2005, while RS in the soil+air warming treatments was 31\% less than the control in 2004 and 23\% less in 2005. Live fine root mass ($<$ 2~mm diameter) was less in the heated than control treatments in 2004 and statistically less (P $<$ 0.01) in 2005. Similar root mass between the two heated treatments suggests that different heating methods (soil-only vs. soil+air warming) can affect the rate of decomposition.},

LIBERTY provides a simulation, at a fine spectral resolution, of quasiinfinite leaf reflectance (as represented by stacked leaves) and single leaf reflectance. Single leaf reflectance and transmittance are important input variables to vegetation canopy reflectance models. A prototype parameterization of LIBERTY was based upon measurements of pine needles and known absorption coefficients of pure component leaf biochemicals. The estimated infinite-reflectance output was compared with the spectra of both dried and fresh pine needles with root mean square errors (RMSE) of 2.87\% and 1.73\%, respectively. The comparisons between measured and estimated reflectance and transmittance values for single needles were also very accurate with RSME of 1.84\% and 1.12\%, respectively. Initial inversion studies have demonstrated that significant improvements can be made to LIBERTY by utilizing in vivo absorption coefficients which have been determined by the inversion process. These results demonstrate the capability of LIBERTY to model accurately the spectral response of pine needles.},

  abstract = {Leaf area index (LAI) is one of the most important biophysical parameters for modeling ecosystem processes such as carbon and water fluxes. Remote sensing provides the only feasible option for mapping LAI continuously over landscapes, but existing methodologies have significant limitations. There is a tradeoff between spatial and temporal resolutions inherent in remotely sensed images, i.e. high spatial resolution images may only be collected infrequently, whereas imagery with fine temporal resolution has necessarily coarser spatial resolution. LAI products created using a single sensor inherit the spatial and temporal characteristics of that sensor. Moreover, the majority of developed algorithms in the literature use spectral information alone, which suffers from the serious limitation of signal saturation at moderately high LAI. We developed a novel approach for mapping effective LAI (Le) using spectral information from Landsat, spatial information from IKONOS, and temporal information from MODIS, which overcomes these limitations. The approach is based on an empirical model developed between Le measured on the ground and spectral and spatial information from remotely sensed images to map annual maximum and minimum Le. A phenological model was fit to a time series of MODIS vegetation indices which was used to model the trajectory between annual minimum and maximum Le. This approach was able to generate maps of Le at Landsat spatial resolution with daily temporal resolution. We tested the approach in the North Carolina Piedmont and generated daily maps of Le for a 100 km2 area. Modeled Le compared well with time series of LAI estimates from two AmeriFlux sites within the study area. A comparison of the MODIS LAI product with spatially averaged Le estimates from our model showed general agreement in forested areas, but large differences in developed areas. This model takes advantage of multidimensional information available from multiple remote sensors and offers significant improvements for mapping leaf area index, particularly for forested areas where spectral indices tend to saturate.},

  abstract = {* Increasingly, ecologists are using functional and phylogenetic approaches to quantify the relative importance of stochastic, abiotic filtering and biotic filtering processes shaping the pattern of species co-occurrence. A remaining challenge in functional and phylogenetic analyses of tropical tree communities is to successfully integrate the functional and phylogenetic structure of tree communities across spatial and size scales and habitats in a single analysis.

* We analysed the functional and phylogenetic structure of tree assemblages in a 20-ha tropical forest dynamics plot in south-west China. Because the influence of biotic interactions may become more apparent as cohorts age, on local scales, and in resource-rich environments, we perform our analyses across three size classes, six spatial scales and six distinct habitat types, using 10 plant functional traits and a molecular phylogeny for the $>$400 tree taxa found in the plot.

* All traits, except leaf area and stem-specific resistance, had significant, albeit weak phylogenetic signal. For canopy species, phylogenetic clustering in small and medium size classes turned to phylogenetic overdispersion in the largest size class and this change in dispersion with size was found in each habitat type and across all spatial scales. On fine spatial scales, functional dispersion changed from clustering to overdispersion with increasing size classes. However, on larger spatial scales assemblages were functionally clustered for all size classes and habitats.

* Phylogenetic and functional structure across spatial and size scales and habitats gave strong support for a deterministic model of species co-occurrence rather than for a neutral model. The results also support the hypothesis that abiotic determinism is more important at larger scales, while biotic determinism is more important on smaller scales within habitats.},

  abstract = {Temperate forest tree species that span large geographical areas and climatic gradients often have high levels of genetic variation. Such species are ideal for testing how neutral demographic factors and climate-driven selection structure genetic variation within species, and how this genetic variation can affect ecological communities. Here, we quantified genetic variation in vegetative phenology and growth traits in narrowleaf cottonwood, Populus angustifolia, using three common gardens planted with genotypes originating from source populations spanning the species' range along the Rocky Mountains of North America (ca. 1700~km). We present three main findings. First, we found strong evidence of divergent selection (QST~$>$~FST) on fall phenology (bud set) with adaptive consequences for frost avoidance. We also found evidence for selection on bud flush duration, tree height, and basal diameter, resulting in population differentiation. Second, we found strong associations with climate variables that were strongly correlated with latitude of origin. More strongly differentiated traits also showed stronger climate correlations, which emphasizes the role that climate has played in divergent selection throughout the range. We found population~\texttimes~garden interaction effects; for some traits, this accounted for more of the variance than either factor alone. Tree height was influenced by the difference in climate of the source and garden locations and declined with increasing transfer distance. Third, growth traits were correlated with dependent arthropod community diversity metrics. Synthesis. Overall, we conclude that climate has influenced genetic variation and structure in phenology and growth traits and leads to local adaptation in P.~angustifolia, which can then impact dependent arthropod species. Importantly, relocation of genotypes far northward or southward often resulted in poor growth, likely due to a phenological mismatch with photoperiod, the proximate cue for fall growth cessation. Genotypes moved too far southward suffer from early growth cessation, whereas those moved too far northward are prone to fall frost and winter dieback. In the face of current and forecasted climate change, habitat restoration, forestry, and tree breeding efforts should utilize these findings to better match latitudinal and climatic source environments with management locations for optimal future outcomes.},

This paper synthesizes current understanding of disturbance with an emphasis on fundamental contributions to contemporary landscape and ecosystem ecology, then identifies future research priorities. Studies of disturbance led to insights about heterogeneity, scale, and thresholds in space and time and catalyzed new paradigms in ecology. Because they create vegetation patterns, disturbances also establish spatial patterns of many ecosystem processes on the landscape. Drivers of global change will produce new spatial patterns, altered disturbance regimes, novel trajectories of change, and surprises. Future disturbances will continue to provide valuable opportunities for studying pattern\textendash{}process interactions. Changing disturbance regimes will produce acute changes in ecosystems and ecosystem services over the short (years to decades) and long term (centuries and beyond). Future research should address questions related to (1) disturbances as catalysts of rapid ecological change, (2) interactions among disturbances, (3) relationships between disturbance and society, especially the intersection of land use and disturbance, and (4) feedbacks from disturbance to other global drivers. Ecologists should make a renewed and concerted effort to understand and anticipate the causes and consequences of changing disturbance regimes.

  abstract = {The ratio of leaf area to ground area (leaf area index, LAI) is an important state variable in ecosystem studies since it influences fluxes of matter and energy between the land surface and the atmosphere. As a basis for generating temporally continuous and spatially distributed datasets of LAI, the current study contributes an analysis of its spatial variability and spatial structure. Soil-vegetation-atmosphere fluxes of water, carbon and energy are nonlinearly related to LAI. Therefore, its spatial heterogeneity, i.e., the combination of spatial variability and structure, has an effect on simulations of these fluxes. To assess LAI spatial heterogeneity, we apply a Comprehensive Data Analysis Approach that combines data from remote sensing (5 m resolution) and simulation (150 m resolution) with field measurements and a detailed land use map. Test area is the arable land in the fertile loess plain of the Rur catchment on the Germany-Belgium-Netherlands border. LAI from remote sensing and simulation compares well with field measurements. Based on the simulation results, we describe characteristic crop-specific temporal patterns of LAI spatial variability. By means of these patterns, we explain the complex multimodal frequency distributions of LAI in the remote sensing data. In the test area, variability between agricultural fields is higher than within fields. Therefore, spatial resolutions less than the 5 m of the remote sensing scenes are sufficient to infer LAI spatial variability. Frequency distributions from the simulation agree better with the multimodal distributions from remote sensing than normal distributions do. The spatial structure of LAI in the test area is dominated by a short distance referring to field sizes. Longer distances that refer to soil and weather can only be derived from remote sensing data. Therefore, simulations alone are not sufficient to characterize LAI spatial structure. It can be concluded that a comprehensive picture of LAI spatial heterogeneity and its temporal course can contribute to the development of an approach to create spatially distributed and temporally continuous datasets of LAI.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to follow the response to drought stress in a Poa pratensis canopy exposed to various levels of soil moisture deficit. We tracked the changes in the canopy reflectance (450\textendash{}2450 nm) and retrieved vegetation properties (Leaf Area Index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll content (Cab), leaf water content (Cw), leaf dry matter content (Cdm) and senescent material (Cs)) during a drought episode. Spectroscopic techniques and radiative transfer model (RTM) inversion were employed to monitor the gradual manifestation of drought effects in a laboratory setting. Plots of 21 cm \texttimes{} 14.5 cm surface area with Poa pratensis plants that formed a closed canopy were divided into a well-watered control group and a group subjected to water stress for 36 days. In a regular weekly schedule, canopy reflectance and destructive measurements of LAI and Cab were taken. Spectral analysis indicated the first sign of stress after 4\textendash{}5 days from the start of the experiment near the water absorption bands (at 1930 nm, 1440 nm) and in the red (at 675 nm). Spectroscopic techniques revealed plant stress up to 6 days earlier than visual inspection. Of the water stress-related vegetation indices, the response of Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI\_1241) and Normalized Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI\_norm) were significantly stronger in the stressed group than the control. To observe the effects of stress on grass properties during the drought episode, we used the RTMo (RTM of solar and sky radiation) model inversion by means of an iterative optimization approach. The performance of the model inversion was assessed by calculating R2 and the Normalized Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between retrieved and measured LAI (R2 = 0.87, NRMSE = 0.18) and Cab (R2 = 0.74, NRMSE = 0.15). All parameters retrieved by model inversion co-varied with soil moisture deficit. However, the first strong sign of water stress on the retrieved grass properties was detected as a change of Cw followed by Cab and Cdm in the earlier stages. The results from this study indicate that the spectroscopic techniques and RTMo model inversion have a promising potential of detecting stress on the spectral reflectance and grass properties before they become visibly apparent.},

Reducing uncertainties in such models can improve both basic scientific understanding and our predictive capacity, but rarely are ecosystem models employed in the design of field campaigns. We provide a synthesis of carbon cycle uncertainty analyses conducted using the Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer ecoinformatics workflow with the Ecosystem Demography model v2. This work is a synthesis of multiple projects, using Bayesian data assimilation techniques to incorporate field data and trait databases across temperate forests, grasslands, agriculture, short rotation forestry, boreal forests, and tundra. We report on a number of data needs that span a wide array of diverse biomes, such as the need for better constraint on growth respiration, mortality, stomatal conductance, and water uptake. We also identify data needs that are biome specific, such as photosynthetic quantum efficiency at high latitudes. We recommend that future data collection efforts balance the bias of past measurements toward aboveground processes in temperate biomes with the sensitivities of different processes as represented by ecosystem models. \textcopyright{}2014.

  abstract = {Since its inception, the Farquhar et al. (1980) model of photosynthesis has been a mainstay for relating biochemistry to environmental conditions from chloroplast to global levels in terrestrial plants. Many variables could be assigned from basic enzyme kinetics, but the model also required measurements of maximum rates of photosynthetic electron transport (J max), carbon assimilation (Vcmax), conductance of CO2 into (g s) and through (g m) the leaf, and the rate of respiration during the day (R d). This review focuses on improving the accuracy of these measurements, especially fluxes from photorespiratory CO2, CO2 in the transpiration stream, and through the leaf epidermis and cuticle. These fluxes, though small, affect the accuracy of all methods of estimating mesophyll conductance and several other photosynthetic parameters because they all require knowledge of CO2 concentrations in the intercellular spaces. This review highlights modified methods that may help to reduce some of the uncertainties. The approaches are increasingly important when leaves are stressed or when fluxes are inferred at scales larger than the leaf.},

We estimated global net primary production (NPP) from 1982 to 1999 using a light use efficiency model driven by satellite-derived canopy parameters from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer and climate data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis project. We estimated a summed heterotrophic respiration and fire carbon flux as the residual between NPP and the terrestrial net carbon flux inferred from an atmospheric inversion model, excluding the impacts of land use change. We propose that for global applications this approach may be more robust than traditional, biophysically based approaches of simulating heterotrophic respiration. NPP interannual variability was significantly related to ENSO, particularly at lower latitudes (22.5$^\circ$N\textendash{}22.5$^\circ$S) but was weakly related to global temperature. Global heterotrophic respiration and fire carbon fluxes were strongly correlated with global temperature (7.9 pgC/$^\circ$C). Our results confirm the dependence of global heterotrophic respiration and fire carbon fluxes on interannual temperature variability and strongly suggest that ENSO-mediated NPP variability influences the atmospheric CO2 growth rate.},

  abstract = {Increasing attention is being given to chlorophyll fluorescence (F) for global monitoring of vegetation due to its relationship with physiology. New progress has been made in the methodological and technical aspects of signal retrieval with the recently published low-resolution global maps of fluorescence. Nevertheless, little progress has been made in the interpretation of the F signal when quantified in large pixels, an important issue due to the effects of structure, percentage cover, shadows, and background. High-resolution (40 cm) airborne hyperspectral imagery is used in this letter to assess the retrieval of fluorescence by the Fraunhofer line depth method from pure tree crowns and aggregated pixels. Due to canopy heterogeneity, the F signal extracted from aggregated pixels is highly degraded. A poor relationship is obtained between fluorescence extracted from pure tree crowns (Fcrown) and that quantified from pixels aggregating pure tree crowns, shadows, and background (Faggregated) (R2 = 0.25; p $<$; 0.01). The relationship between F and stomatal conductance (used as a physiological indicator) decreases as a function of aggregation, yielding R2 = 0.69 (p $<$; 0.01) when calculated from pure tree crowns and R2 = 0.38 (p $<$; 0.05) from pixels containing crown, shadows, and soil. This letter demonstrates the need for methods to accurately retrieve a pure-vegetation fluorescence signal from aggregated pixels. The FluorMODleaf and FluorSAIL models were combined with the geometric forest light interaction model (FLIM) model and led to the ``FluorFLIM'' model developed for this letter. Simulations conducted with FluorFLIM obtain predictive relationships between Fcrown and Faggregated pixels as a function of percentage cover, enabling the estimation of pure-crown F from aggregated pixels (R2 = 0.72, p $<$; 0.01).},

We examined to what extent plant traits, which reflect species' functional adaptations, can capture functional differences between predefined PFTs and which traits optimally describe these differences.

* We applied Gaussian kernel density estimation to determine probability density functions for individual PFTs in an n-dimensional trait space and compared predicted PFTs with observed PFTs. All possible combinations of 1\textendash{}6 traits from a database with 18 different traits (total of 18~287 species) were tested.

* A variety of trait sets had approximately similar performance, and 4\textendash{}5 traits were sufficient to classify up to 85\% of the species into PFTs correctly, whereas this was 80\% for a bioclimatically defined tree PFT classification. Well-performing trait sets included combinations of correlated traits that are considered functionally redundant within a single plant strategy.

* This analysis quantitatively demonstrates how structural differences between PFTs are reflected in functional differences described by particular traits. Differentiation between PFTs is possible despite large overlap in plant strategies and traits, showing that PFTs are differently positioned in multidimensional trait space. This study therefore provides the foundation for important applications for predictive ecology.},

  abstract = {An UV-exclusion experiment was conducted on Mediterranean plant species grown in pots: the evergreen sclerophyllous shrub Arbutus unedo and the deciduous woody crop Vitis vinifera. After 130 days, of exclusion of UVB and both UVA and UVB radiations, during leaf unfolding and development, the plants were exposed to the ambient solar radiation (about 80\% of the whole solar spectrum). The different radiative treatments were obtained with tunnels, covered with appropriate filters (cutting UV radiation), where the plants grown. The leaf UV absorbing compounds were analysed, during the growing season, in both species, in plants under the different radiative regimes. The flavonols content in leaf epidermis was, also periodically assessed, in both species, by means of a non-destructive optical index (the FLAV index of the Multiplex sensor). Structural characteristics and functionality of the photosynthetic apparatus of the plants were assessed by means of chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements.

The UV-exclusion provoked a reduction of UVA-absorbing compounds, mainly flavonols, in the leaves of both species. The results evidenced an increase of these compounds over time in plants previously grown under both UV-exclusion treatments, especially in V. vinifera. Chlorophyll a fluorescence analysis showed a delay in the development of the photosynthetic apparatus in V. vinifera leaves previously grown under total UV exclusion (both UVA and UVB) and damage to the oxygen evolving complex. No significant effects of the UV treatments on the leaf photochemical properties were detected in A. unedo. Overall the results highlighted the relevance of UV radiation on the leaf physiology of the species considered and its essential role in the photomorphogenesis of protective substances in the leaves.},

The theoretical basis for the model is that the spatial patterns of multiresolution imagery are diagnostic of tree size. The sills of variograms from images containing larger trees decrease more slowly than those for images containing smaller trees as the image spatial resolution decreases. Tests with generated images, integrated simulation of stand development and its spatial patterns, and Ikonos images show that the model can provide realistic estimates of tree crown size. Errors of the estimated crown size strongly depend on the spatial resolutions of the images. The best combination of spatial resolutions is at the ratio of pixel size to the object size around unity.},

The second objective was to analyze and validate the data quality in order to draw the correct conclusions about the effect of footprint size on WFs from natural and man-made targets. The experiment was carried out in Finland. Footprint variation was generated by acquiring data at different flying heights and by adjusting the transmitted power. The LiDAR campaign was successful and the data were of sufficient quality, except for a 1 dB trend due to the atmosphere. Significant findings were made concerning the magnitude of atmospheric losses, the linearity of the amplitude scale and the bandwidth characteristics of the receiver, the stability of the transmitter, the precision of the amplitude data and the transmission losses in canopies and power lines, as well as the response of WF attributes to footprint size in forest canopies. Multi-footprint data are a promising approach although the tree species-specific signatures were weak.},

  abstract = {Plant hybrid zones are dynamic centers of ecological and evolutionary processes for plants and their associated communities. Studies in the wild and in gardens with synthetic crosses showed that hybrid eucalypts supported the greatest species richness and abundances of insect and fungal taxa. In an updated review of 152 case studies of taxa associated with diverse hybridizing systems, there were 43 (28\%) cases of hybrids being more susceptible than their parent species, 7 (5\%) resistant, 35 (23\%) additive, 35 (23\%) dominant, and 32 (21\%) showed no response to hybridization. Thus, most taxa respond to hybrids in ways that result in equal or greater abundance, and hybrids tend to accumulate the taxa of their parent species. These studies suggest that genetic-based plant traits affect the distribution of many species and that the variation in hybrids can be used as tools to examine the genetic components of community structure and biodiversity. Several patterns have emerged thus far. (1) Genetic variation between classes of hybrids (e.g., F\textsubscript{1}'s vs. backcrosses) may equal or even exceed that found between species. (2) As a reflection of this genetic variation, herbivores are more likely to differentiate between hybrid classes than they are to differentiate between pure plant species. (3) The communities associated with different hybrid classes can differ from one another as well as from their parental species. (4) Generalist and specialist herbivores predictably vary in their responses to hybrids. (5) Plant hybrid zones may represent essential habitat for some arthropod species. (6) Even nesting birds respond to hybridizing plants. (7) Including multiple trophic levels and taxa from microbes to vertebrates, susceptible hybrid genotypes support greater biodiversity than resistant genotypes. (8) The effects of hybridization on common or keystone species can either positively or negatively affect biodiversity. The indirect impacts of hybridization on biodiversity may exceed the direct impacts and may result in "apparent" herbivore resistance or susceptibility at the community level. (9) Although hybrids are often maligned, exotic or problem hybrids generally result from human disturbances, whereas native hybrids are part of natural ecosystems and should be conserved. Three predictions are made: (1) Intermediate genetic differences between the parental species will result in the greatest genetic variation in the hybrid zone, which in turn will have a positive effect on biodiversity. (2) Bidirectional introgression enhances species richness on hybrids, whereas F\textsubscript{1} sterility and unidirectional introgression limit the accumulation of species on hybrids. (3) Although susceptible hybrids are likely to support the greatest biodiversity, the impacts of hybridization on keystone species will be crucial in determining the overall effect.},

  abstract = {Alpine environments in Europe are increasingly affected by more erratic precipitation patterns, and more frequent drought and heat waves. Heat-hardening capacity is a key feature for survival of these abiotic stress factors, but it is poorly understood how heat and drought affect plant performance when combined. The main objectives of this study were (1) to determine maximum heat hardening capacity in 14 selected plant species and (2) to study how alpine plants respond to combined heat and drought stress compared to heat alone. (3) For risk assessment maximum leaf temperatures were measured in the field and (4) important methodological aspects of testing heat tolerance were evaluated. Heat hardening capacity was assessed by Tc, the heat threshold of photosystem II (PS II), and by heat tolerance tests based on visual inspection of leaf tissue damage or potential quantum efficiency of PS II (Fv/Fm). A purpose-built Heat Tolerance Testing System (HTTS) was used, which allows for controlled heat exposure of whole plants under nearly natural conditions. Additionally, in two species from contrasting habitats, Senecio incanus and Primula minima, the dynamics of heat hardening was studied during and after 8 days exposure to heat (H), or to a combination of heat and severe drought (H+D) within a light-transmissive heat hardening chamber at the alpine field site. In both species, H treatment significantly increased heat tolerance (LT50), determined by the HTTS, to 58.0 $^\circ$C and 54.9 $^\circ$C, respectively, and was accompanied by elevated production of abscisic acid (ABA) and salicylic acid (SA), whereas jasmonic acid (JA) levels decreased. Under H+D the LT50 was only 56.5 $^\circ$C and 51.6 $^\circ$C, respectively, and levels of ABA were higher in S. incanus and SA lower in both species in comparison to H. Changes in xanthophyll cycle pigments, $\alpha$-tocopherol and carotenoids:chlorophyll ratio were more pronounced in P. minima than in S. incanus. In P. minima both H and H+D significantly increased singlet oxygen (1O2) scavenging capacity, determined by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR). In the field, the maximum half-hourly mean (HHM) leaf temperature of P. minima (32.2 $^\circ$C) was significantly lower than of S. incanus (46.5 $^\circ$C, a potentially harmful temperature). We conclude that the investigated species are well adapted to the prevailing temperature conditions in the field. They also possess an outstanding heat hardening capacity, but this can be curtailed when heat is combined with drought. As drought further increases leaf temperatures, the risk of suffering lethal heat damage of some species may increase in the future, particularly at south exposed, ruderal alpine sites with uncertain water supply.},

  abstract = {Trait-based approaches have an increasingly dominant role in community ecology. Although trait-based strategy dimensions such as the leaf economic spectrum (LES) have been identified primarily at global-scales, trait variation at the community scale is often interpreted in this context. Here we argue from several lines of evidence that a research priority should be to determine whether global-scale trait relationships hold at more local scales. We review recent literature assessing trait variation at smaller scales, and then present a case study exploring the relationship between the correlation strength of leaf traits and their similarity in variation structure across ecological scales. We find that the correlation strength between pairs of leaf traits does not predict whether the traits respond similarly to different drivers of variation. Instead, correlation strength only sets an upper bound to the dissimilarity in trait variation structure. With moderate correlation strengths, LES traits largely retain the ability to respond independently to different drivers of phenotypic variation at different scales. Recent literature and our results suggest that LES relationships may not hold at local scales. Clarifying under what conditions and at which scales the LES is consistently expressed is necessary for us to make the most of the emerging trait toolbox. This article is protected by copyright.

  abstract = {The research evaluated the information content of spectral reflectance (laboratory and airborne data) for the estimation of needle chlorophyll (CAB) and nitrogen (CN) concentration in Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) needles. To identify reliable predictive models different types of spectral transformations were systematically compared regarding the accuracy of prediction. The results of the cross-validated analysis showed that CAB can be well estimated from laboratory and canopy reflectance data. The best predictive model to estimate CAB was achieved from laboratory spectra using continuum-removal transformed data (R2cv = 0.83 and a relative RMSEcv of 8.1\%, n = 78) and from hyperspectral HyMap data using band-depth normalised spectra (R2cv = 0.90, relative RMSEcv = 2.8\%, n = 13). Concerning the nitrogen concentration, we observed somewhat weaker relations, with however still acceptable accuracies (at canopy level: R2cv = 0.57, relative RMSEcv = 4.6\%). The wavebands selected in the regression models to estimate CAB were typically located in the red edge region and near the green reflectance peak. For CN, additional wavebands related to a known protein absorption feature at 2350 nm were selected. The portion of selected wavebands attributable to known absorption features strongly depends on the type of spectral transformation applied. A method called ``water removal'' (WR) produced for canopy spectra the largest percentage of wavebands directly or indirectly related to known absorption features. The derived chlorophyll and nitrogen maps may support the detection and the monitoring of environmental stressors and are also important inputs to many bio-geochemical process models.},

Here, we used a perfect-deficit approach to identify forest canopy photosynthetic capacity (CPC) deficits and analyze how they correlate to climate extremes, based on observational data measured by the eddy covariance method at 27 forest sites over 146 site-years. We found that droughts severely affect the carbon assimilation capacities of evergreen broadleaf forest (EBF) and deciduous broadleaf forest. The carbon assimilation capacities of Mediterranean forests were highly sensitive to climate extremes, while marine forest climates tended to be insensitive to climate extremes. Our estimates suggest an average global reduction of forest CPC due to unfavorable climate extremes of 6.3 Pg C ($\sim$5.2\% of global gross primary production) per growing season over 2001\textendash{}2010, with EBFs contributing 52\% of the total reduction.},

However, a direct relationship between phylogenetic affiliation and foliar reflectance spectra of species has not been established. We sought to develop this relationship by quantifying the extent to which underlying patterns of phylogenetic structure drive interspecific variation among foliar reflectance spectra within three Neotropical canopy tree communities with varying levels of soil fertility. We interpreted the resulting spectral patterns of phylogenetic signal in the context of foliar biochemical traits that may contribute to the spectral-phylogenetic link. We utilized a multi-model ensemble to elucidate trait-spectral relationships, and quantified phylogenetic signal for spectral wavelengths and traits using Pagel's lambda statistic. Foliar reflectance spectra showed evidence of phylogenetic influence primarily within the visible and shortwave infrared spectral regions. These regions were also selected by the multi-model ensemble as those most important to the quantitative prediction of several foliar biochemical traits. Patterns of phylogenetic organization of spectra and traits varied across sites and with soil fertility, indicative of the complex interactions between the environmental and phylogenetic controls underlying patterns of biodiversity.},

  abstract = {Recent functional trait studies have shown that trait differences may favour certain species (environmental filtering) while simultaneously preventing competitive exclusion (niche partitioning). However, phenomenological trait-dispersion analyses do not identify the mechanisms that generate niche partitioning, preventing trait-based prediction of future changes in biodiversity. We argue that such predictions require linking functional traits with recognised coexistence mechanisms involving spatial or temporal environmental heterogeneity, resource partitioning and natural enemies. We first demonstrate the limitations of phenomenological approaches using simulations, and then (1) propose trait-based tests of coexistence, (2) generate hypotheses about which plant functional traits are likely to interact with particular mechanisms and (3) review the literature for evidence for these hypotheses. Theory and data suggest that all four classes of coexistence mechanisms could act on functional trait variation, but some mechanisms will be stronger and more widespread than others. The highest priority for future research is studies of interactions between environmental heterogeneity and trait variation that measure environmental variables at within-community scales and quantify species' responses to the environment in the absence of competition. Evidence that similar trait-based coexistence mechanisms operate in many ecosystems would simplify biodiversity forecasting and represent a rare victory for generality over contingency in community ecology.},

CO2 fertilization effects explain most of the greening trends in the tropics, whereas climate change resulted in greening of the high latitudes and the Tibetan Plateau. LCC contributed most to the regional greening observed in southeast China and the eastern United States. The regional effects of unexplained factors suggest that the next generation of ecosystem models will need to explore the impacts of forest demography, differences in regional management intensities for cropland and pastures, and other emerging productivity constraints such as phosphorus availability.},

Abstract
Cross-species analyses of plant functional traits have shed light on factors contributing to differences in performance and distribution, but to date most studies have focused on either leaves or stems. We extend these tissue-specific analyses of functional strategy towards a whole-plant approach by integrating data on functional traits for 13~448 leaves and wood tissues from 4672 trees representing 668 species of Neotropical trees. Strong correlations amongst traits previously defined as the leaf economics spectrum reflect a tradeoff between investments in productive leaves with rapid turnover vs. costly physical leaf structure with a long revenue stream. A second axis of variation, the `stem economics spectrum', defines a similar tradeoff at the stem level: dense wood vs. high wood water content and thick bark. Most importantly, these two axes are orthogonal, suggesting that tradeoffs operate independently at the leaf and at the stem levels. By simplifying the multivariate ecological strategies of tropical trees into positions along these two spectra, our results provide a basis to improve global vegetation models predicting responses of tropical forests to global change.},

  abstract = {Winter leaf area index (LAI) of evergreen coniferous forests exerts strong control on the interception of snow, snowmelt and energy balance. Simulation of winter LAI and associated winter processes in land surface models is challenging. Retrieving winter LAI from remote sensing data is difficult due to cloud contamination, poor illumination, lower solar elevation and higher radiation reflection by snow background. Underestimated winter LAI in evergreen coniferous forests is one of the major issues limiting the application of current remote sensing LAI products. It has not been fully addressed in past studies in the literature. In this study, we used needle lifespan to correct winter LAI in a remote sensing product developed by the University of Toronto. For the validation purpose, the corrected winter LAI was then used to calculate land surface albedo at five FLUXNET coniferous forests in Canada. The RMSE and bias values for estimated albedo were 0.05 and 0.011, respectively, for all sites. The albedo map over coniferous forests across Canada produced with corrected winter LAI showed much better agreement with the GLASS (Global LAnd Surface Satellites) albedo product than the one produced with uncorrected winter LAI. The results revealed that the corrected winter LAI yielded much greater accuracy in simulating land surface albedo, making the new LAI product an improvement over the original one.

  abstract = {A geometric-optical forest canopy model that treats conifers as cones casting shadows on a contrasting background explains the major anisotropies in bidirectional reflectance measurements of a conifer forest canopy taken from the literature. The model uses parallelray geometry to describe the illumination and viewing of conifers as three-dimensional cones. Cones are randomly placed and overlap freely. Cone size (height) is distributed lognormally, and cone form, described by the apex angle of the cone, is a negative exponential function of height. The cones are first presumed to be solid dark gray Lambertian objects, located on a lighter gray Lambertian background. To add realism, "translucence" is added and light is allowed to pass through cones with negative exponential attenuation. Both computer simulation and analytical closed-form expressions are implemented. The results show a good qualitative agreement with the directional reflectance measurements of the conifer stand, indicating that the three-dimensional nature of the canopy is a key factor in determining its directional reflectance.},

This knowledge provides insight into how plants have adapted to different environmental pressures, and will lead to better calibration of future vegetation\textendash{}climate models. Location\hspace{0.6em} The data set represents vegetation from 175 sites around the world. Methods\hspace{0.6em} For more than 2500 vascular plant species, we compiled data on leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf life span (LL), nitrogen concentration (Nmass) and photosynthetic capacity (Amass). Site climate was described with several standard indices. Correlation and regression analyses were used for quantifying relationships between single leaf traits and climate. Standardized major axis (SMA) analyses were used for assessing the effect of climate on bivariate relationships between leaf traits. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to summarize multidimensional trait variation. Results\hspace{0.6em} At hotter, drier and higher irradiance sites, (1) mean LMA and leaf N per area were higher; (2) average LL was shorter at a given LMA, or the increase in LL was less for a given increase in LMA (LL\textendash{}LMA relationships became less positive); and (3) Amass was lower at a given Nmass, or the increase in Amass was less for a given increase in Nmass. Considering all traits simultaneously, 18\% of variation along the principal multivariate trait axis was explained by climate. Main conclusions\hspace{0.6em} Trait-shifts with climate were of sufficient magnitude to have major implications for plant dry mass and nutrient economics, and represent substantial selective pressures associated with adaptation to different climatic regimes.},

  abstract = {A strong positive correlation between vegetation canopy bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) in the near infrared (NIR) spectral region and foliar mass-based nitrogen concentration (\%N) has been reported in some temperate and boreal forests. This relationship, if true, would indicate an additional role for nitrogen in the climate system via its influence on surface albedo and may offer a simple approach for monitoring foliar nitrogen using satellite data. We report, however, that the previously reported correlation is an artifact\textemdash{}it is a consequence of variations in canopy structure, rather than of \%N. The data underlying this relationship were collected at sites with varying proportions of foliar nitrogen-poor needleleaf and nitrogen-rich broadleaf species, whose canopy structure differs considerably. When the BRF data are corrected for canopy-structure effects, the residual reflectance variations are negatively related to \%N at all wavelengths in the interval 423\textendash{}855 nm. This suggests that the observed positive correlation between BRF and \%N conveys no information about \%N. We find that to infer leaf biochemical constituents, e.g., N content, from remotely sensed data, BRF spectra in the interval 710\textendash{}790 nm provide critical information for correction of structural influences. Our analysis also suggests that surface characteristics of leaves impact remote sensing of its internal constituents. This further decreases the ability to remotely sense canopy foliar nitrogen. Finally, the analysis presented here is generic to the problem of remote sensing of leaf-tissue constituents and is therefore not a specific critique of articles espousing remote sensing of foliar \%N.},

  abstract = {Our ability to measure and map plant function at multiple ecological scales is critical for understanding current and future changes in Earth's ecosystems and the global carbon budget. Conventional plant functional types (cPFTs) based on a few productivity-related traits have been previously used to simplify and represent major differences in global plant functions, but more recent research has directly focused on the use of functional trait information. Still, sampling limitations have constrained efforts to truly understand the variance and covariance of functional traits globally. Reflectance spectra offer a fast, repeatable, simultaneous measurement of a wide variety of leaf functional traits and could be used to optically define leaf functional types. To evaluate this concept, we measured leaf reflectance from a wide range of species in a diverse set of ecosystems across central and northern California, including observations from multiple individuals, sites, and seasons. Using principal components analysis, we analyzed spectral variation in relation to categorical attributes such as species and cPFTs, as well as to a set of functional trait metrics calculated from the spectra. We found the first three principal components (PCs) to be weakly related to categorical attributes and more strongly related to spectrally-derived functional metrics. Each PC was more strongly associated with different portions of the spectrum and contained different functional information. We applied a hybrid clustering algorithm to the PC coordinates of the observations to define potential optical leaf functional types. Twelve spectral clusters were identified, and these did not correspond directly to either single cPFTs or species. However, each cluster had a unique functional metric profile. Clusters represented both inter- and intra-species and cPFT functional differences driven by taxonomy, trait evolution and environmental responses, demonstrating their value as optical leaf functional types and the value of the clustering approach used here for defining optical types from leaf spectra. Our findings support the notion that cPFTs do not adequately capture differences in leaf function. They demonstrate that spectral measurements can be used to improve both the definition of PFTs as well as our knowledge regarding the covariance of functional traits within these classes.},

New studies analysing the simultaneous provision of multiple services at landscape scale should aid the understanding of multiple ES delivery and trade-offs to support policy, management and land planning. 2.\hspace{0.6em}Here, we propose a new approach for the analysis, mapping and understanding of multiple ES delivery in landscapes. Spatially explicit single ES models based on plant traits and abiotic characteristics are combined to identify `hot' and `cold' spots of multiple ES delivery, and the land use and biotic determinants of such distributions. We demonstrate the value of this trait-based approach as compared to a pure land-use approach for a pastoral landscape from the central French Alps, and highlight how it improves understanding of ecological constraints to, and opportunities for, the delivery of multiple services. 3.\hspace{0.6em}Vegetative height and leaf traits such as leaf dry matter content were response traits strongly influenced by land use and abiotic environment, with follow-on effects on several ecosystem properties, and could therefore be used as functional markers of ES. 4.\hspace{0.6em}Patterns of association among ES were related to the dominant traits underlying different ecosystem properties. The functional decoupling between height and leaf traits provided alternative pathways for high agronomic value, as well as determining hot and cold spots of ES. Traditional land uses such as organic fertilization and mowing or altitude summer grazing were also linked with ES hot spots, because functional characteristics supporting fodder production and quality are compatible with species and functional diversity. 5.\hspace{0.6em}Synthesis. Analyses of ES using plant functional variation across landscapes are a powerful approach to understanding the fundamental ecological mechanisms underlying ES provision, and trade-offs or synergies among services. Sustainable management of species and functionally diverse grassland could simultaneously aim at conserving biodiversity and locally important ES by taking advantage of correlations and trade-offs among different plant functional traits.},

  abstract = {Background Earth system models describe the physical, chemical and biological processes that govern our global climate. While it is difficult to single out one component as being more important than another in these sophisticated models, terrestrial vegetation is a critical player in the biogeochemical and biophysical dynamics of the Earth system. There is much debate, however, as to how plant diversity and function should be represented in these models.
Scope Plant functional types (PFTs) have been adopted by modellers to represent broad groupings of plant species that share similar characteristics (e.g. growth form) and roles (e.g. photosynthetic pathway) in ecosystem function. In this review, the PFT concept is traced from its origin in the early 1800s to its current use in regional and global dynamic vegetation models (DVMs). Special attention is given to the representation and parameterization of PFTs and to validation and benchmarking of predicted patterns of vegetation distribution in high-latitude ecosystems. These ecosystems are sensitive to changing climate and thus provide a useful test case for model-based simulations of past, current and future distribution of vegetation.
Conclusions Models that incorporate the PFT concept predict many of the emerging patterns of vegetation change in tundra and boreal forests, given known processes of tree mortality, treeline migration and shrub expansion. However, representation of above- and especially below-ground traits for specific PFTs continues to be problematic. Potential solutions include developing trait databases and replacing fixed parameters for PFTs with formulations based on trait co-variance and empirical trait\textendash{}environment relationships. Surprisingly, despite being important to land\textendash{}atmosphere interactions of carbon, water and energy, PFTs such as moss and lichen are largely absent from DVMs. Close collaboration among those involved in modelling with the disciplines of taxonomy, biogeography, ecology and remote sensing will be required if we are to overcome these and other shortcomings.},

  abstract = {Monitoring and understanding global change requires a detailed focus on upscaling, the process for extrapolating from the site-specific scale to the smallest scale resolved in regional or global models or earth observing systems. Leaf area index (LAI) is one of the most sensitive determinants of plant production and can vary by an order of magnitude over short distances. The landscape distribution of LAI is generally determined by remote sensing of surface reflectance (e.g. normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI) but the mismatch in scales between ground and satellite measurements complicates LAI upscaling. Here, we describe a series of measurements to quantify the spatial distribution of LAI in a sub-Arctic landscape and then describe the upscaling process and its associated errors. Working from a fine-scale harvest LAI\textendash{}NDVI relationship, we collected NDVI data over a 500~m \texttimes{} 500~m catchment in the Swedish Arctic, at resolutions from 0.2 to 9.0~m in a nested sampling design. NDVI scaled linearly, so that NDVI at any scale was a simple average of multiple NDVI measurements taken at finer scales. The LAI\textendash{}NDVI relationship was scale invariant from 1.5 to 9.0~m resolution. Thus, a single exponential LAI\textendash{}NDVI relationship was valid at all these scales, with similar prediction errors. Vegetation patches were of a scale of $\sim$0.5~m and at measurement scales coarser than this, there was a sharp drop in LAI variance. Landsat NDVI data for the study catchment correlated significantly, but poorly, with ground-based measurements. A variety of techniques were used to construct LAI maps, including interpolation by inverse distance weighting, ordinary Kriging, External Drift Kriging using Landsat data, and direct estimation from a Landsat NDVI\textendash{}LAI calibration. All methods produced similar LAI estimates and overall errors. However, Kriging approaches also generated maps of LAI estimation error based on semivariograms. The spatial variability of this Arctic landscape was such that local measurements assimilated by Kriging approaches had a limited spatial influence. Over scales $>$50~m, interpolation error was of similar magnitude to the error in the Landsat NDVI calibration. The characterisation of LAI spatial error in this study is a key step towards developing spatio-temporal data assimilation systems for assessing C cycling in terrestrial ecosystems by combining models with field and remotely sensed data.},

Here, we report a close correspondence between seasonally changing foliar pigment levels, expressed as chlorophyll/carotenoid ratios, and evergreen photosynthetic activity, leading to a ``chlorophyll/carotenoid index'' (CCI) that tracks evergreen photosynthesis at multiple spatial scales. When calculated from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite sensor, the CCI closely follows the seasonal patterns of daily gross primary productivity of evergreen conifer stands measured by eddy covariance. This discovery provides a way of monitoring evergreen photosynthetic activity from optical remote sensing, and indicates an important regulatory role for carotenoid pigments in evergreen photosynthesis. Improved methods of monitoring photosynthesis from space can improve our understanding of the global carbon budget in a warming world of changing vegetation phenology.},

  abstract = {Aim~ This first global quantification of the relationship between leaf traits and soil nutrient fertility reflects the trade-off between growth and nutrient conservation. The power of soils versus climate in predicting leaf trait values is assessed in bivariate and multivariate analyses and is compared with the distribution of growth forms (as a discrete classification of vegetation) across gradients of soil fertility and climate. Location~ All continents except for Antarctica. Methods~ Data on specific leaf area (SLA), leaf N concentration (LNC), leaf P concentration (LPC) and leaf N:P were collected for 474 species distributed across 99 sites (809 records), together with abiotic information from each study site. Individual and combined effects of soils and climate on leaf traits were quantified using maximum likelihood methods. Differences in occurrence of growth form across soil fertility and climate were determined by one-way ANOVA. Results~ There was a consistent increase in SLA, LNC and LPC with increasing soil fertility. SLA was related to proxies of N supply, LNC to both soil total N and P and LPC was only related to proxies of P supply. Soil nutrient measures explained more variance in leaf traits among sites than climate in bivariate analysis. Multivariate analysis showed that climate interacted with soil nutrients for SLA and area-based LNC. Mass-based LNC and LPC were determined mostly by soil fertility, but soil P was highly correlated to precipitation. Relationships of leaf traits to soil nutrients were stronger than those of growth form versus soil nutrients. In contrast, climate determined distribution of growth form more strongly than it did leaf traits. Main conclusions~ We provide the first global quantification of the trade-off between traits associated with growth and resource conservation `strategies' in relation to soil fertility. Precipitation but not temperature affected this trade-off. Continuous leaf traits might be better predictors of plant responses to nutrient supply than growth form, but growth forms reflect important aspects of plant species distribution with climate.},

  abstract = {Phenological events, such as bud burst, are strongly linked to ecosystem processes in temperate deciduous forests. However, the exact nature and magnitude of how seasonal and interannual variation in air temperatures influence phenology is poorly understood, and model-based phenology representations fail to capture local- to regional-scale variability arising from differences in species composition. In this paper, we use a combination of surface meteorological data, species composition maps, remote sensing, and ground-based observations to estimate models that better represent how community-level species composition affects the phenological response of deciduous broadleaf forests to climate forcing at spatial scales that are typically used in ecosystem models. Using time series of canopy greenness from repeat digital photography, citizen science data from the USA National Phenology Network, and satellite remote sensing-based observations of phenology, we estimated and tested models that predict the timing of spring leaf emergence across five different deciduous broadleaf forest types in the eastern United States. Specifically, we evaluated two different approaches: (i) using species-specific models in combination with species composition information to `upscale' model predictions and (ii) using repeat digital photography of forest canopies that observe and integrate the phenological behavior of multiple representative species at each camera site to calibrate a single model for all deciduous broadleaf forests. Our results demonstrate variability in cumulative forcing requirements and photoperiod cues across species and forest types, and show how community composition influences phenological dynamics over large areas. At the same time, the response of different species to spatial and interannual variation in weather is, under the current climate regime, sufficiently similar that the generic deciduous forest model based on repeat digital photography performed comparably to the upscaled species-specific models. More generally, results from this analysis demonstrate how in~situ observation networks and remote sensing data can be used to synergistically calibrate and assess regional parameterizations of phenology in models.},

By contrast, Rdark at a standard T (25$^\circ$C, Rdark25) was threefold higher in the Arctic than in the tropics, and twofold higher at arid than at mesic sites.

Rdark25 values at any given Vcmax25 or [N] were higher in herbs than in woody plants.

* The results highlight variation in Rdark among species and across global gradients in T and aridity. In addition to their ecological significance, the results provide a framework for improving representation of Rdark in terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) and associated land-surface components of Earth system models (ESMs).},

As such, how is it that some of the largest sources of uncertainty in future climate projections are found in the terrestrial biosphere? This uncertainty stems from how the terrestrial biosphere is modeled with respect to the myriad of biogeochemical, physical, and dynamic processes represented (or not) in numerous models that contribute to projections of Earth's future. Here, we provide an overview of the processes included in terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs), including various approaches to representing any one given process, as well as the processes that are missing and/or uncertain. We complement this with a comprehensive review of individual TBMs, marking the differences, uniqueness, and recent and planned developments. To conclude, we summarize the latest results in benchmarking activities, particularly as linked to recent model intercomparison projects, and outline a path forward to reducing uncertainty in the contribution of the terrestrial biosphere to global atmospheric change.},

  abstract = {A basic assumption of the trait-based approach in plant ecology is that differences in functional trait values are greater between species than within species. We questioned this assumption by assessing (1) the relative extent of inter- and intraspecific leaf trait variation throughout a complete growing season (phenological variation) in a group of deciduous and evergreen woody species, and (2) whether species rankings based on leaf traits were maintained across the growing season. We analysed leaf mass per area (LMA) and leaf nutrient concentrations (C, N, P), including the C:N and N:P ratios. Intraspecific trait variation (ITV) due to phenology was significantly greater than interspecific variation for leaf N concentration on a mass basis (Nm; 68.90 \%) and for the leaf C:N ratio (60.60 \%), whereas interspecific variation was significantly higher than ITV for LMA (62.30 \%) and for leaf C concentration on a mass (Cm) and area (Ca) basis (Cm 70.40 \%; Ca 65.30 \%). ITV was particularly low for LMA ($<$20 \%). Species rankings were highly modified by phenology for a number of leaf traits (Pm, N:P ratio) but were relatively well conserved throughout the growing season for others (LMA, Nm). Patterns of ITV across the growing season differed significantly between deciduous and evergreen species for all traits except leaf P but did not vary between native and exotic species. Overall, our results show that intraspecific phenological variation in leaf traits may be similar to or greater than interspecific variation and that temporal patterns of ITV vary considerably among traits and species, especially for leaf nutrient concentrations, factors which can potentially affect quantitative interspecific relationships.},

  abstract = {In the context of phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, most climate simulations use prescribed atmospheric CO2 concentration and therefore do not interactively include the effect of carbon cycle feedbacks. However, the representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) scenario has additionally been run by earth system models with prescribed CO2 emissions. This paper analyzes the climate projections of 11 earth system models (ESMs) that performed both emission-driven and concentration-driven RCP8.5 simulations. When forced by RCP8.5 CO2 emissions, models simulate a large spread in atmospheric CO2; the simulated 2100 concentrations range between 795 and 1145 ppm. Seven out of the 11 ESMs simulate a larger CO2 (on average by 44 ppm, 985 $\pm$ 97 ppm by 2100) and hence higher radiative forcing (by 0.25 W m-2) when driven by CO2 emissions than for the concentration-driven scenarios (941 ppm). However, most of these models already overestimate the present-day CO2, with the present-day biases reasonably well correlated with future atmospheric concentrations' departure from the prescribed concentration. The uncertainty in CO2 projections is mainly attributable to uncertainties in the response of the land carbon cycle. As a result of simulated higher CO2 concentrations than in the concentration-driven simulations, temperature projections are generally higher when ESMs are driven with CO2 emissions. Global surface temperature change by 2100 (relative to present day) increased by 3.9$^\circ$ $\pm$ 0.9$^\circ$C for the emission-driven simulations compared to 3.7$^\circ$ $\pm$ 0.7$^\circ$C in the concentration-driven simulations. Although the lower ends are comparable in both sets of simulations, the highest climate projections are significantly warmer in the emission-driven simulations because of stronger carbon cycle feedbacks.},

Conventional species-based, regional biodiversity assessments are rarely adequate for policy planning and decision making. We show how new ground and remotely-sensed survey methods can be coordinated to help elucidate and predict relationships between biodiversity, land use and soil properties along complex biophysical gradients that typify many similar landscapes worldwide. In the lower Zambezi valley, Mozambique we used environmental, gradient-directed transects (gradsects) to sample vascular plant species, plant functional types, vegetation structure, soil properties and land-use characteristics. Soil fertility indices were derived using novel multidimensional scaling of soil properties. To facilitate spatial analysis, we applied a probabilistic remote sensing approach, analyzing Landsat 7 satellite imagery to map photosynthetically active and inactive vegetation and bare soil along each gradsect. Despite the relatively low sample number, we found highly significant correlations between single and combined sets of specific plant, soil and remotely sensed variables that permitted testable spatial projections of biodiversity and soil fertility across the regional land-use mosaic. This integrative and rapid approach provides a low-cost, high-return and readily transferable methodology that permits the ready identification of testable biodiversity indicators for adaptive management of biodiversity and potential agricultural productivity.},

However, there are low-frequency changes in the Pacific mean state forced by changes in the ENSO statistics. The variability of PDV2 is associated with decadal modulation in ENSO amplitude.},

  abstract = {The invasive weed Solanum mauritianum (bugweed) has infested large areas of plantation forests in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Bugweed often forms dense infestations and rapidly capitalises on available natural resources hindering the production of forest resources. Precise assessment of bugweed canopy cover, especially at low abundance cover, is essential to an effective weed management strategy. In this study, the utility of AISA Eagle airborne hyperspectral data (393\textendash{}994 nm) with the new generation Worldview-2 multispectral sensor (427\textendash{}908 nm) was compared to detect the abundance of bugweed cover within the Hodgsons Sappi forest plantation. Using sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis (SPLS-DA), the best detection results were obtained when performing discrimination using the remotely sensing images combined with LiDAR. Overall classification accuracies subsequently improved by 10\% and 11.67\% for AISA and Worldview-2 respectively, with improved detection accuracies for bugweed cover densities as low as 5\%. The incorporation of LiDAR worked well within the SPLS-DA framework for detecting the abundance of bugweed cover using remotely sensed data. In addition, the algorithm performed simultaneous dimension reduction and variable selection successfully whereby wavelengths in the visible (393\textendash{}670 nm) and red-edge regions (725\textendash{}734 nm) of the spectrum were the most effective.},

  abstract = {* We assessed whether diversity in plant hydraulic traits can explain the observed diversity in plant responses to water stress in seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTFs).

* The Ecosystem Demography model 2 (ED2) was updated with a trait-driven mechanistic plant hydraulic module, as well as novel drought-phenology and plant water stress schemes. Four plant functional types were parameterized on the basis of meta-analysis of plant hydraulic traits. Simulations from both the original and the updated ED2 were evaluated against 5~yr of field data from a Costa Rican SDTF site and remote-sensing data over Central America.

* The updated model generated realistic plant hydraulic dynamics, such as leaf water potential and stem sap flow. Compared with the original ED2, predictions from our novel trait-driven model matched better with observed growth, phenology and their variations among functional groups. Most notably, the original ED2 produced unrealistically small leaf area index (LAI) and underestimated cumulative leaf litter. Both of these biases were corrected by the updated model. The updated model was also better able to simulate spatial patterns of LAI dynamics in Central America.

* Plant hydraulic traits are intercorrelated in SDTFs. Mechanistic incorporation of plant hydraulic traits is necessary for the simulation of spatiotemporal patterns of vegetation dynamics in SDTFs in vegetation models.},

Empirically calculated variograms from real digital images demonstrate many of the findings of previous theoretical research using a disc model of scenes and simulated images including: (1) the heights of variograms are related to the density, or proportion of an area covered by objects, (2) the range of influence of a variogram is related to the size of the objects in the scene, and (3) the shape of the variogram becomes more rounded as the variance in the distribution of the sizes of objects increases. In addition, empirically calculated variograms show the periodicity in ground scenes and reveal anisotropy. Two-dimensional variograms are more difficult to interpret with respect to shape, periodicity, and distance to the sill but are necessary for revealing anisotropy. Results are encouraging concerning future possibilities for directly recovering ground-scene parameters using variograms if an appropriate model of ground scenes is used.},

  abstract = {Tropical cyclones (TCs), often associated with massive flooding and landslides in the Southeast US (SE US), provide a significant input of freshwater to the hydrologic system, and their timing and trajectory significantly impact drought severity and persistence. This manuscript investigates the sensitivity of gross primary productivity (GPP) in the SE US to TC activity using the 1D column implementation of the Duke Coupled Hydrology Model with Vegetation (DCHM-V) including coupled water and energy cycles and a biochemical representation of photosynthesis. Decadal-scale simulations of water, energy and carbon fluxes were conducted at high temporal (30-min) and spatial (4\,km) resolution over the period 2002-2012. At local scales, model results without calibration compare well against AmeriFlux tower data. At regional scales, differences between the DCHM-V estimates and the MODIS GPP product reflect the spatial organization of soil hydraulic properties and soil moisture dynamics by physiographic region, highlighting the links between the water and carbon cycles. To isolate the contribution of TC precipitation to SE US productivity, control forcing simulations are contrasted with simulations where periods of TC activity in the atmospheric forcing data were replaced with climatology. During wet years, TC activity impacts productivity in 40-50\% of the SE US domain and explains a regional GPP increase of 3-5\,Mg C/m2 that is 9\% of the warm season total. In dry years, 23-34\% of the domain exhibits a smaller positive response that corresponds to 4 - 8\% of the seasonal carbon uptake, depending on TC timing and trajectory.},

  abstract = {Thanks to such second- and third-generation sensor systems as Thematic Mapper, SPOT, and AVHRR, a user of digital satellite imagery for remote sensing of the earth's surface now has a choice of image scales ranging from 10 m to 1 km. The choice of an appropriate scale, or spatial resolution, for a particular application depends on several factors. These include the information desired about the ground scene, the analysis methods to be used to extract the information, and the spatial structure of the scene itself. A graph showing how the local variance of a digital image for a scene changes as the resolution-cell size changes can help in selecting an appropriate image scale. Such graphs are obtained by imaging the scene at fine resolution and then collapsing the image to successively coarser resolutions while calculating a measure of local variance. The local variance/resolution graphs for the forested, agricultural, and urban/suburban environments examined in this paper reveal the spatial structure of each type of scene, which is a function of the sizes and spatial relationships of the objects the scene contains. At the spatial resolutions of SPOT and Thematic Mapper imagery, local image variance is relatively high for forested and urban/suburban environments, suggesting that information-extracting techniques utilizing texture, context, and mixture modeling are appropriate for these sensor systems. In agricultural environments, local variance is low, and the more traditional classifiers are appropriate.},

  abstract = {The PROSPECT leaf optical model has, to date, combined the effects of photosynthetic pigments, but a finer discrimination among the key pigments is important for physiological and ecological applications of remote sensing. Here we present a new calibration and validation of PROSPECT that separates plant pigment contributions to the visible spectrum using several comprehensive datasets containing hundreds of leaves collected in a wide range of ecosystem types. These data include leaf biochemical (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, carotenoids, water, and dry matter) and optical properties (directional\textendash{}hemispherical reflectance and transmittance measured from 400~nm to 2450~nm). We first provide distinct in vivo specific absorption coefficients for each biochemical constituent and determine an average refractive index of the leaf interior. Then we invert the model on independent datasets to check the prediction of the biochemical content of intact leaves. The main result of this study is that the new chlorophyll and carotenoid specific absorption coefficients agree well with available in vitro absorption spectra, and that the new refractive index displays interesting spectral features in the visible, in accordance with physical principles. Moreover, we improve the chlorophyll estimation (RMSE = 9~$\mathrm{\mu}$g/cm2) and obtain very encouraging results with carotenoids (RMSE = 3~$\mathrm{\mu}$g/cm2). Reconstruction of reflectance and transmittance in the 400\textendash{}2450~nm wavelength domain using PROSPECT is also excellent, with small errors and low to negligible biases. Improvements are particularly noticeable for leaves with low pigment content.},

For the vegetative phase of wheat, a robust empiric description of the influence of N nutrition status (NNI) on this pattern is still pending. We investigated the influence of NNI on leaf: stem partitioning of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), until end of leaf growth. The evaluation based on N rate experiments (0\textendash{}320~kg N ha-1) from three subsequent seasons (2003/4 to 2005/6), with five modern bread wheat cultivars, carried out near Kiel (northern Germany). A previously published model was adapted for describing the influence of NNI on dry matter partitioning. Starting from the allometric leaf: stem relationship of situations with NNI $\geq$1, a correction term was used, to describe the partitioning under varying N supply. The correction term assumes a linear increase of the stem fraction, proportional to the difference between a NNI threshold and actual NNI. The allometric partitioning was found to shift towards stem fraction, if the NNI falls below 1.38. The slope of the relative increase was determined with 0.6. Both dimensionless parameters of the correction term were found to be highly significant. The second aim was to quantify how N status impacts the N allocation between shoot organs. Dry matter-based N dilution curves were fitted for stem (plateau power) and leaf (plateau linear), for situations with sufficient N supply (NNI $\geq$1). The `expected' shoot N demand was calculated as a function of observed dry matter and N dilution for both organs. The N deficit was defined as difference between expected and observed shoot N. Plotting stem against shoot N deficit reveals that 63~\% of the shoot deficit was allocated to the stem (R2~=~0.98). Implications for crop modelling are discussed.},

It is assumed, based on ecophysiological observations and arguments, that leaf physiological properties vary throughout the plant canopy in response to the radiation-weighted time-mean profile of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). These modifications yield a simpler and more robust theoretical relationship between canopy biophysical rates (photosynthesis, conductance) and spectral vegetation indices (SVI). The results indicate that area-averaged SVI, as obtained from coarse resolution satellite sensors, may give good estimates of the area-integrals of photosynthesis and conductance even for spatially heterogenous (though physiologically uniform) vegetation covers.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.rse.2016.10.023},
  abstract = {Accurate three-dimensional information on canopy structure contributes to better understanding of radiation fluxes within the canopy and the physiological processes associated with them. Small-footprint airborne laser scanning (ALS) data proved valuable for characterising the three-dimensional structure of forest canopies and the retrieval of biophysical parameters such as plant and leaf area index (PAI and LAI), fractional cover or canopy layering. Nevertheless, few studies analysed combined occluded and observed canopy elements in dense vegetation as a result of airborne laser scanning geometries. The occluded space contains a substantial amount of vegetation elements (i.e. leaf, needle and wood material), which are missing in the analysis of the three-dimensional canopy structure. Consequently, this will lead to erroneous retrieval of biophysical parameters. In this study, we introduce a voxel traversal algorithm to characterise ALS observation patterns inside a voxel grid. We analyse the dependence of occluded and unobserved canopy volume on pulse density, flight strip overlap and season of overflight in a temperate mixed forest. ALS measurements under leaf-on and leaf-off conditions were used. For cross-comparison purposes, terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) measurements on a 50 \texttimes{}50 m2 subplot under leaf-on conditions were used. TLS acquisitions were able to depict the three-dimensional structure of the forest plot in high detail, ranging up to the top-most canopy layer.

Our results at 1 m voxel size show that even with the highest average pulse density of 11 pulses/m2, at least 25\% of the forest canopy volume remains occluded in the ALS acquisition under leaf-on conditions. Comparison with TLS acquisitions further showed that roughly 28\% of the vegetation elements detected by the TLS acquisitions were not detected by the ALS system due to occlusion effects. By combining leaf-on and leaf-off acquisitions, we were able to recover roughly 7\% of the occluded vegetation elements from the leaf-on acquisition. We find that larger flight strip overlap can significantly increase the amount of observed canopy volume due to the added observation angles and increased pulse density.},

  abstract = {A major goal of remote sensing is the development of generalizable algorithms to repeatedly and accurately map ecosystem properties across space and time. Imaging spectroscopy has great potential to map vegetation traits that cannot be retrieved from broadband spectral data, but rarely have such methods been tested across broad regions. Here we illustrate a general approach for estimating key foliar chemical and morphological traits through space and time using NASA's Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-Classic). We apply partial least squares regression (PLSR) to data from 237 field plots within 51 images acquired between 2008 and 2011. Using a series of 500 randomized 50/50 subsets of the original data, we generated spatially explicit maps of seven traits (leaf mass per area (Marea), percentage nitrogen, carbon, fiber, lignin, and cellulose, and isotopic nitrogen concentration, $\delta$15N) as well as pixel-wise uncertainties in their estimates based on error propagation in the analytical methods. Both Marea and \%N PLSR models had a R2 $>$ 0.85. Root mean square errors (RMSEs) for both variables were less than 9\% of the range of data. Fiber and lignin were predicted with R2 $>$ 0.65 and carbon and cellulose with R2 $>$ 0.45. Although R2 of \%C and cellulose were lower than Marea and \%N, the measured variability of these constituents (especially \%C) was also lower, and their RMSE values were beneath 12\% of the range in overall variability. Model performance for $\delta$15N was the lowest (R2 = 0.48, RMSE = 0.95\textperthousand), but within 15\% of the observed range. The resulting maps of chemical and morphological traits, together with their overall uncertainties, represent a first-of-its-kind approach for examining the spatiotemporal patterns of forest functioning and nutrient cycling across a broad range of temperate and sub-boreal ecosystems. These results offer an alternative to categorical maps of functional or physiognomic types by providing non-discrete maps (i.e., on a continuum) of traits that define those functional types. A key contribution of this work is the ability to assign retrieval uncertainties by pixel, a requirement to enable assimilation of these data products into ecosystem modeling frameworks to constrain carbon and nutrient cycling projections.},

  abstract = {Humans are altering the composition of biological communities through a variety of activities that increase rates of species invasions and species extinctions, at all scales, from local to global. These changes in components of the Earth's biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties. Human activities can modify all of the above factors; here we focus on modification of these biotic controls. The scientific community has come to a broad consensus on many aspects of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, including many points relevant to management of ecosystems. Further progress will require integration of knowledge about biotic and abiotic controls on ecosystem properties, how ecological communities are structured, and the forces driving species extinctions and invasions. To strengthen links to policy and management, we also need to integrate our ecological knowledge with understanding of the social and economic constraints of potential management practices. Understanding this complexity, while taking strong steps to minimize current losses of species, is necessary for responsible management of Earth's ecosystems and the diverse biota they contain. Based on our review of the scientific literature, we are certain of the following conclusions: 1)\,Species' functional characteristics strongly influence ecosystem properties. Functional characteristics operate in a variety of contexts, including effects of dominant species, keystone species, ecological engineers, and interactions among species (e.g., competition, facilitation, mutualism, disease, and predation). Relative abundance alone is not always a good predictor of the ecosystem-level importance of a species, as even relatively rare species (e.g., a keystone predator) can strongly influence pathways of energy and material flows. 2)\,Alteration of biota in ecosystems via species invasions and extinctions caused by human activities has altered ecosystem goods and services in many well-documented cases. Many of these changes are difficult, expensive, or impossible to reverse or fix with technological solutions. 3)\,The effects of species loss or changes in composition, and the mechanisms by which the effects manifest themselves, can differ among ecosystem properties, ecosystem types, and pathways of potential community change. 4)\,Some ecosystem properties are initially insensitive to species loss because (a) ecosystems may have multiple species that carry out similar functional roles, (b) some species may contribute relatively little to ecosystem properties, or (c) properties may be primarily controlled by abiotic environmental conditions. 5)\,More species are needed to insure a stable supply of ecosystem goods and services as spatial and temporal variability increases, which typically occurs as longer time periods and larger areas are considered. We have high confidence in the following conclusions: 1)\,Certain combinations of species are complementary in their patterns of resource use and can increase average rates of productivity and nutrient retention. At the same time, environmental conditions can influence the importance of complementarity in structuring communities. Identification of which and how many species act in a complementary way in complex communities is just beginning. 2)\,Susceptibility to invasion by exotic species is strongly influenced by species composition and, under similar environmental conditions, generally decreases with increasing species richness. However, several other factors, such as propagule pressure, disturbance regime, and resource availability also strongly influence invasion success and often override effects of species richness in comparisons across different sites or ecosystems. 3)\,Having a range of species that respond differently to different environmental perturbations can stabilize ecosystem process rates in response to disturbances and variation in abiotic conditions. Using practices that maintain a diversity of organisms of different functional effect and functional response types will help preserve a range of management options. Uncertainties remain and further research is necessary in the following areas: 1)\,Further resolution of the relationships among taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, and community structure is important for identifying mechanisms of biodiversity effects. 2)\,Multiple trophic levels are common to ecosystems but have been understudied in biodiversity/ecosystem functioning research. The response of ecosystem properties to varying composition and diversity of consumer organisms is much more complex than responses seen in experiments that vary only the diversity of primary producers. 3)\,Theoretical work on stability has outpaced experimental work, especially field research. We need long-term experiments to be able to assess temporal stability, as well as experimental perturbations to assess response to and recovery from a variety of disturbances. Design and analysis of such experiments must account for several factors that covary with species diversity. 4)\,Because biodiversity both responds to and influences ecosystem properties, understanding the feedbacks involved is necessary to integrate results from experimental communities with patterns seen at broader scales. Likely patterns of extinction and invasion need to be linked to different drivers of global change, the forces that structure communities, and controls on ecosystem properties for the development of effective management and conservation strategies. 5)\,This paper focuses primarily on terrestrial systems, with some coverage of freshwater systems, because that is where most empirical and theoretical study has focused. While the fundamental principles described here should apply to marine systems, further study of that realm is necessary. Despite some uncertainties about the mechanisms and circumstances under which diversity influences ecosystem properties, incorporating diversity effects into policy and management is essential, especially in making decisions involving large temporal and spatial scales. Sacrificing those aspects of ecosystems that are difficult or impossible to reconstruct, such as diversity, simply because we are not yet certain about the extent and mechanisms by which they affect ecosystem properties, will restrict future management options even further. It is incumbent upon ecologists to communicate this need, and the values that can derive from such a perspective, to those charged with economic and policy decision-making.},

  abstract = {A globally consistent methodology using satellite imagery was implemented to quantify gross forest cover loss (GFCL) from 2000 to 2005 and to compare GFCL among biomes, continents, and countries. GFCL is defined as the area of forest cover removed because of any disturbance, including both natural and human-induced causes. GFCL was estimated to be 1,011,000 km2 from 2000 to 2005, representing 3.1\% (0.6\% per year) of the year 2000 estimated total forest area of 32,688,000 km2. The boreal biome experienced the largest area of GFCL, followed by the humid tropical, dry tropical, and temperate biomes. GFCL expressed as the proportion of year 2000 forest cover was highest in the boreal biome and lowest in the humid tropics. Among continents, North America had the largest total area and largest proportion of year 2000 GFCL. At national scales, Brazil experienced the largest area of GFCL over the study period, 165,000 km2, followed by Canada at 160,000 km2. Of the countries with $>$1,000,000 km2 of forest cover, the United States exhibited the greatest proportional GFCL and the Democratic Republic of Congo the least. Our results illustrate a pervasive global GFCL dynamic. However, GFCL represents only one component of net change, and the processes driving GFCL and rates of recovery from GFCL differ regionally. For example, the majority of estimated GFCL for the boreal biome is due to a naturally induced fire dynamic. To fully characterize global forest change dynamics, remote sensing efforts must extend beyond estimating GFCL to identify proximate causes of forest cover loss and to estimate recovery rates from GFCL.},

  abstract = {Terrestrial ecosystem and carbon cycle feedbacks will significantly impact future climate, but their responses are highly uncertain. Models and tipping point analyses suggest the tropics and arctic/boreal zone carbon\textendash{}climate feedbacks could be disproportionately large. In situ observations in those regions are sparse, resulting in high uncertainties in carbon fluxes and fluxes. Key parameters controlling ecosystem carbon responses, such as plant traits, are also sparsely observed in the tropics, with the most diverse biome on the planet treated as a single type in models. We analyzed the spatial distribution of in situ data for carbon fluxes, stocks and plant traits globally and also evaluated the potential of remote sensing to observe these quantities. New satellite data products go beyond indices of greenness and can address spatial sampling gaps for specific ecosystem properties and parameters. Because environmental conditions and access limit in situ observations in tropical and arctic/boreal environments, use of space-based techniques can reduce sampling bias and uncertainty about tipping point feedbacks to climate. To reliably detect change and develop the understanding of ecosystems needed for prediction, significantly, more data are required in critical regions. This need can best be met with a strategic combination of remote and in situ data, with satellite observations providing the dense sampling in space and time required to characterize the heterogeneity of ecosystem structure and function.},

  abstract = {Functional diversity is a component of biodiversity that generally concerns the range of things that organisms do in communities and ecosystems. Here, we review how functional diversity can explain and predict the impact of organisms on ecosystems and thereby provide a mechanistic link between the two. Critical points in developing predictive measures of functional diversity are the choice of functional traits with which organisms are distinguished, how the diversity of that trait information is summarized into a measure of functional diversity, and that the measures of functional diversity are validated through quantitative analyses and experimental tests. There is a vast amount of trait information available for plant species and a substantial amount for animals. Choosing which traits to include in a particular measure of functional diversity will depend on the specific aims of a particular study. Quantitative methods for choosing traits and for assigning weighting to traits are being developed, but need much more work before we can be confident about trait choice. The number of ways of measuring functional diversity is growing rapidly. We divide them into four main groups. The first, the number of functional groups or types, has significant problems and researchers are more frequently using measures that do not require species to be grouped. Of these, some measure diversity by summarizing distances between species in trait space, some by estimating the size of the dendrogram required to describe the difference, and some include information about species' abundances. We show some new and important differences between these, as well as what they indicate about the responses of assemblages to loss of individuals. There is good experimental and analytical evidence that functional diversity can provide a link between organisms and ecosystems but greater validation of measures is required. We suggest that non-significant results have a range of alternate explanations that do not necessarily contradict positive effects of functional diversity. Finally, we suggest areas for development of techniques used to measure functional diversity, highlight some exciting questions that are being addressed using ideas about functional diversity, and suggest some directions for novel research.},

  abstract = {The response of the terrestrial carbon cycle to climate change is among the largest uncertainties affecting future climate change projections. The feedback between the terrestrial carbon cycle and climate is partly determined by changes in the turnover time of carbon in land ecosystems, which in turn is an ecosystem property that emerges from the interplay between climate, soil and vegetation type. Here we present a global, spatially explicit and observation-based assessment of whole-ecosystem carbon turnover times that combines new estimates of vegetation and soil organic carbon stocks and fluxes. We find that the overall mean global carbon turnover time is nature13731-m6jpg10K3620 years (95 per cent confidence interval). On average, carbon resides in the vegetation and soil near the Equator for a shorter time than at latitudes north of 75$^\circ$ north (mean turnover times of 15 and 255 years, respectively). We identify a clear dependence of the turnover time on temperature, as expected from our present understanding of temperature controls on ecosystem dynamics. Surprisingly, our analysis also reveals a similarly strong association between turnover time and precipitation. Moreover, we find that the ecosystem carbon turnover times simulated by state-of-the-art coupled climate/carbon-cycle models vary widely and that numerical simulations, on average, tend to underestimate the global carbon turnover time by 36 per cent. The models show stronger spatial relationships with temperature than do observation-based estimates, but generally do not reproduce the strong relationships with precipitation and predict faster carbon turnover in many semi-arid regions. Our findings suggest that future climate/carbon-cycle feedbacks may depend more strongly on changes in the hydrological cycle than is expected at present and is considered in Earth system models.},

  abstract = {Tropical forests convert more atmospheric carbon into biomass each year than any terrestrial ecosystem on Earth, underscoring the importance of accurate tropical forest structure and biomass maps for the understanding and management of the global carbon cycle. Ecologists have long used field inventory plots as the main tool for understanding forest structure and biomass at landscape-to-regional scales, under the implicit assumption that these plots accurately represent their surrounding landscape. However, no study has used continuous, high-spatial-resolution data to test whether field plots meet this assumption in tropical forests. Using airborne LiDAR (light detection and ranging) acquired over three regions in Peru, we assessed how representative a typical set of field plots are relative to their surrounding host landscapes. We uncovered substantial mean biases (9\textendash{}98\%) in forest canopy structure (height, gaps, and layers) and aboveground biomass in both lowland Amazonian and montane Andean landscapes. Moreover, simulations reveal that an impractical number of 1-ha field plots (from 10 to more than 100 per landscape) are needed to develop accurate estimates of aboveground biomass at landscape scales. These biases should temper the use of plots for extrapolations of forest dynamics to larger scales, and they demonstrate the need for a fundamental shift to high-resolution active remote sensing techniques as a primary sampling tool in tropical forest biomass studies. The potential decrease in the bias and uncertainty of remotely sensed estimates of forest structure and biomass is a vital step toward successful tropical forest conservation and climate-change mitigation policy.},

  abstract = {Climate change is intensifying the hydrologic cycle and is expected to increase the frequency of extreme wet and dry years. Beyond precipitation amount, extreme wet and dry years may differ in other ways, such as the number of precipitation events, event size, and the time between events. We assessed 1614 long-term (100~year) precipitation records from around the world to identify key attributes of precipitation regimes, besides amount, that distinguish statistically extreme wet from extreme dry years. In general, in regions where mean annual precipitation (MAP) exceeded 1000~mm, precipitation amounts in extreme wet and dry years differed from average years by \textasciitilde{}40\% and 30\%, respectively. The magnitude of these deviations increased to $>$60\% for dry years and to $>$150\% for wet years in arid regions (MAP$<$500~mm). Extreme wet years were primarily distinguished from average and extreme dry years by the presence of multiple extreme (large) daily precipitation events (events $>$99th percentile of all events); these occurred twice as often in extreme wet years compared to average years. In contrast, these large precipitation events were rare in extreme dry years. Less important for distinguishing extreme wet from dry years were mean event size and frequency, or the number of dry days between events. However, extreme dry years were distinguished from average years by an increase in the number of dry days between events. These precipitation regime attributes consistently differed between extreme wet and dry years across 12 major terrestrial ecoregions from around the world, from deserts to the tropics. Thus, we recommend that climate change experiments and model simulations incorporate these differences in key precipitation regime attributes, as well as amount into treatments. This will allow experiments to more realistically simulate extreme precipitation years and more accurately assess the ecological consequences.},

  abstract = {The remote sensing of grass aboveground biomass (AGB) has gained considerable attention, with substantial research being conducted in the past decades. Of significant importance is their photosynthetic pathways (C3 and C4), which epitomizes a fundamental eco-physiological distinction of grasses functional types. With advances in technology and the availability of remotely sensed data at different spatial, spectral, radiometric and temporal resolutions, coupled with the need for detailed information on vegetation condition, the monitoring of C3 and C4 grasses AGB has received renewed attention, especially in the light of global climate change, biodiversity and, most importantly, food security. This paper provides a detailed survey on the progress of remote sensing application in determining C3 and C4 grass species AGB. Importantly, the importance of species functional type is highlighted in conjunction with the availability and applicability of different remote sensing datasets, with refined resolutions, which provide an opportunity to monitor C3 and C4 grasses AGB. While some progress has been made, this review has revealed the need for further remote sensing studies to model the seasonal (cyclical) variability, as well as long-term AGB changes in C3 and C4 grasses, in the face of climate change and food security. Moreover, the findings of this study have shown the significance of shifting towards the application of advanced statistical models, to further improve C3 and C4 grasses AGB estimation accuracy.},

  abstract = {A common radiometric response is required for quantitative analysis of multiple satellite images of a scene acquired on different dates with different sensors. We describe a technique to ``radiometrically rectify'' multiple Landsat images of a scene to a reference image, and evaluate it using a pair of Landsat 5 images acquired 2 years apart. All rectified images should appear as if they were acquired with the same sensor, while observing through the atmospheric and illumination conditions of the reference image. If atmospheric optical depth and sensor calibration date are available for the reference image, then an atmospheric correction algorithm may be used to correct all the rectified images to absolute surface reflectance. The ``radiometric rectification'' algorithm identifies ``radiometric control sets,'' i.e., sets of scene landscape elements with a mean reflectance which is expected to change little with time. The average digital count values of these radiometric control sets are used to calculate linear transforms relating digital count values between images. We evaluate the technique empirically with a pair of Landsat 5 TM images of a scene for which surface reflectance and atmospheric optical depth data are available. We also examine its performance under a wide range of atmospheric conditions using simulations based on atmospheric models. We find that the radiometric rectification algorithm performed well for the visible and near infrared bands, adjusting surface reflectance for the effects of relative atmospheric differences to within 1\%. The performance is not as good for the midinfrared bands on TM. There are several possible causes for this; we could not determine which was the most important. We conclude from these studies that for scenes containing reflectance stable elements, radiometric rectification should be a useful alternative to atmospheric radiative transfer codes and sensor calibration approaches when reliable atmospheric optical depth data or calibration coefficients are not available. When atmospheric optical data and sensor calibration information are available for one of a sequence of radiometrically rectified images, an atmospheric radiative transfer code may be used to correct each image in the sequence to absolute surface reflectance.},

  abstract = {Dynamic models are pivotal for projecting forest dynamics in a changing climate, from the local to the global scale. They encapsulate the processes of tree population dynamics with varying resolution. Yet, almost invariably, tree mortality is modeled based on simple, theoretical assumptions that lack a physiological and/or empirical basis. Although this has been widely criticized and a growing number of empirically derived alternatives are available, they have not been tested systematically in models of forest dynamics. We implemented an inventory-based and a tree-ring-based mortality routine in the forest gap model ForClim v3.0. We combined these routines with a stochastic and a deterministic approach for the determination of tree status (alive vs. dead). We tested the four new model versions for two Norway spruce forests in the Swiss Alps, one of which was managed (inventory time series spanning 72 years) and the other was unmanaged (41 years). Furthermore, we ran long-term simulations (\textasciitilde{}400 years) into the future under three climate scenarios to test model behavior under changing environmental conditions. The tests against inventory data showed an excellent match of simulated basal area and stem numbers at the managed site and a fair agreement at the unmanaged site for three of the four empirical mortality models, thus rendering the choice of one particular model difficult. However, long-term simulations under current climate revealed very different behavior of the mortality models in terms of simulated changes of basal area and stem numbers, both in timing and magnitude, thus indicating high sensitivity of simulated forest dynamics to assumptions on tree mortality. Our results underpin the potential of using empirical mortality routines in forest gap models. However, further tests are needed that span other climatic conditions and mixed forests. Short-term simulations to benchmark model behavior against empirical data are insufficient; long-term tests are needed that include both nonequilibrium and equilibrium conditions. Thus, there is the potential to greatly improve the robustness of future projections of forest dynamics via more reliable tree mortality submodels.},

Abstract
Predicting changes in community composition and ecosystem function in a rapidly changing world is a major research challenge in ecology. Traits-based approaches have elicited much recent interest, yet individual studies are not advancing a more general, predictive ecology. Significant progress will be facilitated by adopting a coherent theoretical framework comprised of three elements: an underlying trait distribution, a performance filter defining the fitness of traits in different environments, and a dynamic projection of the performance filter along some environmental gradient. This framework allows changes in the trait distribution and associated modifications to community composition or ecosystem function to be predicted across time or space. The structure and dynamics of the performance filter specify two key criteria by which we judge appropriate quantitative methods for testing traits-based hypotheses. Bayesian multilevel models, dynamical systems models and hybrid approaches meet both these criteria and have the potential to meaningfully advance traits-based ecology.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.ppees.2011.04.003},
  abstract = {Trait-based studies have become extremely common in plant ecology. Trait-based approaches often rely on the tacit assumption that intraspecific trait variability (ITV) is negligible compared to interspecific variability, so that species can be characterized by mean trait values. Yet, numerous recent studies have challenged this assumption by showing that ITV significantly affects various ecological processes. Accounting for ITV may thus strengthen trait-based approaches, but measuring trait values on a large number of individuals per species and site is not feasible. Therefore, it is important and timely to synthesize existing knowledge on ITV in order to (1) decide critically when ITV should be considered, and (2) establish methods for incorporating this variability. Here we propose a practical set of rules to identify circumstances under which ITV should be accounted for. We formulate a spatial trait variance partitioning hypothesis to highlight the spatial scales at which ITV cannot be ignored in ecological studies. We then refine a set of four consecutive questions on the research question, the spatial scale, the sampling design, and the type of studied traits, to determine case-by-case if a given study should quantify ITV and test its effects. We review methods for quantifying ITV and develop a step-by-step guideline to design and interpret simulation studies that test for the importance of ITV. Even in the absence of quantitative knowledge on ITV, its effects can be assessed by varying trait values within species within realistic bounds around the known mean values. We finish with a discussion of future requirements to further incorporate ITV within trait-based approaches. This paper thus delineates a general framework to account for ITV and suggests a direction towards a more quantitative trait-based ecology.},

This study aims to investigate whether an analysis method for the retrieval of leaf area index (LAI), developed and validated on the 4 m resolution scale of six airborne datasets covering the 2012 growing period, is transferable to the spaceborne 30 m resolution scale of the future EnMAP mission. The widely used PROSAIL model is applied to generate look-up-table (LUT) libraries, by which the model is inverted to derive LAI information. With the goal of defining the impact of different selection criteria in the inversion process, different techniques for the LUT based inversion are tested, such as several cost functions, type and amount of artificial noise, number of considered solutions and type of averaging method. The optimal inversion procedure (Laplace, median, 4\% inverse multiplicative noise, 350 out of 100,000 averages) is identified by validating the results against corresponding in-situ measurements (n = 330) of LAI. Finally, the best performing LUT inversion (R2 = 0.65, RMSE = 0.64) is adapted to simulated EnMAP data, generated from the airborne acquisitions. The comparison of the retrieval results to upscaled maps of LAI, previously validated on the 4 m scale, shows that the optimized retrieval method can successfully be transferred to spaceborne EnMAP data.},

  abstract = {Ecological models help us understand how ecosystems function, predict responses to global change, and identify future research needs. However, widespread use of models is limited by the technical challenges of model\textendash{}data synthesis and information management. To address these challenges, we present an ecoinformatic workflow, the Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (PEcAn), which facilitates model analysis. Herein we describe the PEcAn modules that synthesize plant trait data to estimate model parameters, propagate parameter uncertainties through to model output, and evaluate the contribution of each parameter to model uncertainty. We illustrate a comprehensive approach to the estimation of parameter values, starting with a statement of prior knowledge that is refined by species-level data using Bayesian meta-analysis; this is the first use of a rigorous meta-analysis to inform the parameters of a mechanistic ecosystem model. Parameter uncertainty is propagated using ensemble methods to estimate model uncertainty. Variance decomposition allows us to quantify the contribution of each parameter to model uncertainty; this information can be used to prioritize subsequent data collection. By streamlining the use of models and focusing efforts to identify and constrain the dominant sources of uncertainty in model output, the approach used by PEcAn can speed scientific progress. We demonstrate PEcAn's ability to incorporate data to reduce uncertainty in productivity of a perennial grass monoculture (Panicum virgatum L.) modeled by the Ecosystem Demography model. Prior estimates were specified for 15 model parameters, and species-level data were available for seven of these. Meta-analysis of species-level data substantially reduced the contribution of three parameters (specific leaf area, maximum carboxylation rate, and stomatal slope) to overall model uncertainty. By contrast, root turnover rate, root respiration rate, and leaf width had little effect on model output; therefore trait data had little impact on model uncertainty. For fine-root allocation, the decrease in parameter uncertainty was offset by an increase in model sensitivity. Remaining model uncertainty is driven by growth respiration, fine-root allocation, leaf turnover rater, and specific leaf area. By establishing robust channels of feedback between data collection and ecosystem modeling, PEcAn provides a framework for more efficient and integrative science.},

  abstract = {There are many studies showing the active optical reaction of a green leaf to the changing surroundings based on chloroplast movement and their rearrangement in plant cells. These studies concentrated mostly on the effect of one feature (leaf type, leaf side or light type) on the leaf optical spectra. We have measured the diffuse reflectance and transmittance spectra of tobacco green leaves in combination of 4 variants: in normal and water infiltrated leaves, in collimated or diffuse incident light, on both the adaxial and abaxial leaf sides, and for the face or side chloroplast arrangement. A Simple Explicitly Non-Linear Empirical model for Leaf Optical Properties (SENLELOP model) is used to theoretically describe, simulate and fit the deviations from the Lambert\textendash{}Beer's law causing nonlinearity in the measured spectral changes. It is shown that the incident diffuse light is captured by the leaf more effectively than the collimated light. The light incident from the adaxial leaf side is more effectively absorbed than the same light incident from the abaxial leaf side. The air in intercellular spaces of natural leaf increases about twice the beam path and strongly deepens the non-linearity of the absorption process when compared with water infiltrated leaf. The chloroplast arrangement in the palisade cells is reflected in most of the studied differences. The leaf absorbance changed in our case of tobacco leaves up to 30\% when the chloroplasts moved from the face to the side position. This change depends strongly on the wavelength and quite slightly on the character of incident light. Further analysis predicts that in practice the effect of chloroplast rearrangement on the reflectance spectra is in dependence on the wavelength of the light about 2\textendash{}5\% in our case of fully developed green leaves but can be higher in some cases. Thus it can affect values of some of the indices used in the remote sensing.},

  abstract = {Differentiation of species distributions along environmental gradients and phenotypic specialization help explain the co-presence of 17 oak species that might otherwise be expected to competitively exclude one another. In an effort to understand the role of niche differentiation in the co-presence of these congeneric species in north-central Florida, we examined the community structure of oak-dominated forests in this region in relation to environmental variables and a suite of life history and physiological traits. Landscape distribution patterns of oaks and other woody species were determined from randomly established plots in three state parks. Soil moisture, nutrient availability, and fire regime were found to be critical factors influencing community structure, and the distribution of oak species was strongly correlated with these gradients. Detrended correspondence analysis of species' distributions supported the grouping of oak species into three major community types: (1) hammock, (2) sandhill, and (3) scrub. Principal components of multiple traits also supported differentiation of oak species into these three groups. There is clear evidence for ecological sorting among the oaks in these forests as species partition environmental gradients more than expected by chance, and most functional traits of species correspond to species distributions as predicted based on a priori understanding of trait function. Across phylogenetic lineages, species showed evolutionary convergence in function and habitat preference. In contrast, leaf-level traits were conserved within phylogenetic lineages and were not well correlated with local habitat factors, but rather with the broader geographic distributions and northern range limits of species. The cumulative results reported here provide strong evidence that oak species specialize for particular niches via trade-offs in functional traits, and such niche partitioning contributes to the high diversity of oak species at the landscape level. At smaller spatial scales, phylogenetic diversity among the oaks is likely to be important in promoting their coexistence through other mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Decadal fluctuations of the ocean and atmosphere over the North Pacific Ocean significantly affect the weather and climate of North America and Eurasia. They also cause transitions between different states of marine ecosystems across the Pacific Ocean. An important fraction of North Pacific low-frequency variability is linked to the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation, a climate pattern associated with decadal fluctuations of the ocean circulation. Decadal variations in the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation are characterized by a pattern of sea surface temperature anomalies that resemble the central Pacific El Ni{\~n}o, a dominant mode of interannual variability with far-reaching effects on global climate patterns. Here we use an ensemble of simulations with a coupled ocean\textendash{}atmosphere model to show that the sea surface temperature anomalies associated with central Pacific El Ni{\~n}o force changes in the extra-tropical atmospheric circulation. These changes in turn drive the decadal fluctuations of the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation. Given that central Pacific El Ni{\~n}o events could become more frequent with increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, we infer that the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation may play an increasingly important role in shaping Pacific climate and marine ecosystems in the twenty-first century.},

  abstract = {The morphological and biochemical properties of plant canopies are strong predictors of photosynthetic capacity and nutrient cycling. Remote sensing research at the leaf and canopy scales has demonstrated the ability to characterize the biochemical status of vegetation canopies using reflectance spectroscopy, including at the leaf level and canopy level from air- and spaceborne imaging spectrometers. We developed a set of accurate and precise spectroscopic calibrations for the determination of leaf chemistry (contents of nitrogen, carbon, and fiber constituents), morphology (leaf mass per area, Marea), and isotopic composition ($\delta$15N) of temperate and boreal tree species using spectra of dried and ground leaf material. The data set consisted of leaves from both broadleaf and needle-leaf conifer species and displayed a wide range in values, determined with standard analytical approaches: 0.7\textendash{}4.4\% for nitrogen (Nmass), 42\textendash{}54\% for carbon (Cmass), 17\textendash{}58\% for fiber (acid-digestible fiber, ADF), 7\textendash{}44\% for lignin (acid-digestible lignin, ADL), 3\textendash{}31\% for cellulose, 17\textendash{}265 g/m2 for Marea, and -9.4\textperthousand{} to 0.8\textperthousand{} for $\delta$15N. The calibrations were developed using a partial least-squares regression (PLSR) modeling approach combined with a novel uncertainty analysis. Our PLSR models yielded model calibration (independent validation shown in parentheses) R2 and the root mean square error (RMSE) values, respectively, of 0.98 (0.97) and 0.10\% (0.13\%) for Nmass, R2 = 0.77 (0.73) and RMSE = 0.88\% (0.95\%) for Cmass, R2 = 0.89 (0.84) and RMSE = 2.8\% (3.4\%) for ADF, R2 = 0.77 (0.69) and RMSE = 2.4\% (3.9\%) for ADL, R2 = 0.77 (0.72) and RMSE = 1.4\% (1.9\%) for leaf cellulose, R2 = 0.62 (0.60) and RMSE = 0.91\textperthousand{} (1.5\textperthousand) for $\delta$15N, and R2 = 0.88 (0.87) with RMSE = 17.2 g/m2 (22.8 g/m2) for Marea. This study demonstrates the potential for rapid and accurate estimation of key foliar traits of forest canopies that are important for ecological research and modeling activities, with a single calibration equation valid over a wide range of northern temperate and boreal species and leaf physiognomies. The results provide the basis to characterize important variability between and within species, and across ecological gradients using a rapid, cost-effective, easily replicated method.},

  abstract = {The functional biogeography of tropical forests is expressed in foliar chemicals that are key physiologically based predictors of plant adaptation to changing environmental conditions including climate. However, understanding the degree to which environmental filters sort the canopy chemical characteristics of forest canopies remains a challenge. Here, we report on the elevation and soil-type dependence of forest canopy chemistry among 75 compositionally and environmentally distinct forests in nine regions, with a total of 7819 individual trees representing 3246 species collected, identified and assayed for foliar traits. We assessed whether there are consistent relationships between canopy chemical traits and both elevation and soil type, and evaluated the general role of phylogeny in mediating patterns of canopy traits within and across communities. Chemical trait variation and partitioning suggested a general model based on four interconnected findings. First, geographic variation at the soil-Order level, expressing broad changes in fertility, underpins major shifts in foliar phosphorus (P) and calcium (Ca). Second, elevation-dependent shifts in average community leaf dry mass per area (LMA), chlorophyll, and carbon allocation (including nonstructural carbohydrates) are most strongly correlated with changes in foliar Ca. Third, chemical diversity within communities is driven by differences between species rather than by plasticity within species. Finally, elevation- and soil-dependent changes in N, LMA and leaf carbon allocation are mediated by canopy compositional turnover, whereas foliar P and Ca are driven more by changes in site conditions than by phylogeny. Our findings have broad implications for understanding the global ecology of humid tropical forests, and their functional responses to changing climate.},

  abstract = {Ongoing climate change has caused extreme climatic events to happen more frequently, which can fundamentally threaten plant growth and survivorship. In this review paper, we found that extreme climatic events, such as heat waves, frost, drought and flooding, usually reduces plant production and induces mortality. The magnitude of impacts on production and mortality are exceedingly variable, which likely result from different severities of the climate extremes, sensitivities of various processes, vegetation types, and inherent regulatory mechanisms of plants and ecosystems. Climatologically severe events may not necessarily trigger plant responses. Different processes respond to the same extreme events differently. Such different responses also vary with species. Moreover, plants likely activate a variety of physiological and molecular mechanisms regulate their responses to extremes. Documenting those variable responses and identifying their causes are critical to advancing our understanding. Nevertheless, our research has to move beyond the documentation of phenomenon to reveal fundamental mechanisms underlying plant responses to climate extremes. Toward that goal, we need to define extreme climatic events under a plant perspective and evaluate different response patterns of various processes to climate extremes. In this review, we also propose to focus our future research on manipulative field experiments and coordinated networks of experiments at multiple sites over different regions to understand the real-world responses of plants and ecosystems.},

It links the spectral variation of canopy reflectance, which is mainly related to leaf biochemical contents, with its directional variation, which is primarily related to canopy architecture and soil/vegetation contrast. This link is key to simultaneous estimation of canopy biophysical/structural variables for applications in agriculture, plant physiology, or ecology, at different scales.

Based on recent advances in community ecology, we explore the merits of a traits-based vegetation model to deal with current shortcomings. Location\hspace{0.6em} Global. Methods\hspace{0.6em} A research review of current concepts and information, providing a new perspective, supported by quantitative analysis of a global traits database. Results\hspace{0.6em} Continuous and process-based trait\textendash{}environment relations are central to a traits-based approach and allow us to directly calculate fluxes based on functional characteristics. By quantifying community assembly concepts, it is possible to predict trait values from environmental drivers, although these relations are still imperfect. Through the quantification of these relations, effects of adaptation and species replacement upon environmental changes are implicitly accounted for. Such functional links also allow direct calculation of fluxes, including those related to feedbacks through the nitrogen and water cycle. Finally, a traits-based model allows the prediction of new trait combinations and no-analogue ecosystem functions projected to arise in the near future, which is not feasible in current vegetation models. A separate calculation of ecosystem fluxes and PFT occurrences in traits-based models allows for flexible vegetation classifications. Main conclusions\hspace{0.6em} Given the advantages described above, we argue that traits-based modelling deserves consideration (although it will not be easy) if one is to aim for better climate projections.},

  doi = {10.1111/1365-2745.12562},
  abstract = {* Root, stem and leaf traits are thought to be functionally coordinated to maximize the efficiency of acquiring and using limited resources. However, evidence is mixed for consistent whole-plant trait coordination among woody plants, and we lack a clear understanding of the adaptive value of root traits along soil resource gradients. If fine roots are the below-ground analogue to leaves, then low specific root length (SRL) and high tissue density should be common on infertile soil. Here, we test the prediction that root, stem and leaf traits and relative growth rate respond in unison with soil fertility gradients.

* We measured fine root, stem and leaf traits and relative growth rate on individual seedlings of 66 tree species grown in controlled conditions. Our objectives were (i) to determine whether multiple root traits align with growth rate, leaf and stem traits and with each other and (ii) to quantify the relationships between community-weighted mean root traits and two strong soil fertility gradients that differed in spatial extent and community composition.

* At the species level, fast growth rates were associated with low root and stem tissue density and high specific leaf area. SRL and root diameter were not clearly related to growth rate and loaded on a separate principal component from the plant economic spectrum.

* At the community level, growth rate was positively related to soil fertility, and root tissue density (RTD) and branching were negatively related to soil fertility. SRL was negatively related and root diameter was positively related to soil fertility on the large-scale gradient that included ectomycorrhizal angiosperms.

* Synthesis. Root, stem and leaf tissue traits of tree seedlings are coordinated and influence fitness along soil fertility gradients. RTD responds in unison with above-ground traits to soil fertility gradients; however, root traits are multidimensional because SRL is orthogonal to the plant economic spectrum. In contrast to leaves, trees are not constrained in the way they construct fine roots: plants can construct high or low SRL roots of any tissue density. High RTD is the most consistent below-ground trait that reflects adaptation to infertile soil.},

  doi = {10.1016/S0034-4257(96)00067-3},
  abstract = {The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) has been widely used for remote sensing of vegetation for many years. This index uses radiances or reflectances from a red channel around 0.66 $\mu$m and a near-IR channel around 0.86 $\mu$m. The red channel is located in the strong chlorophyll absorption region, while the near-IR channel is located in the high reflectance plateau of vegetation canopies. The two channels sense very different depths through vegetation canopies. In this article, another index, namely, the normalized difference water index (NDWI), is proposed for remote sensing of vegetation liquid water from space. NDWI is defined as ($\varrho$(0.86 $\mu$m) - $\varrho$(1.24 $\mu$m))($\varrho$(0.86 $\mu$m) + $\varrho$(1.24 $\mu$m)), where $\varrho$ represents the radiance in reflectance units. Both the 0.86-$\mu$m and the 1.24-$\mu$m channels are located in the high reflectance plateau of vegetation canopies. They sense similar depths through vegetation canopies. Absorption by vegetation liquid water near 0.86 $\mu$m is negligible. Weak liquid absorption at 1.24 $\mu$m is present. Canopy scattering enhances the water absorption. As a result, NDWI is sensitive to changes in liquid water content of vegetation canopies. Atmospheric aerosol scattering effects in the 0.86\textendash{}1.24 $\mu$m region are weak. NDWI is less sensitive to atmospheric effects than NDVI. NDWI does not remove completely the background soil reflectance effects, similar to NDVI. Because the information about vegetation canopies contained in the 1.24-$\mu$m channel is very different from that contained in the red channel near 0.66 $\mu$m, NDWI should be considered as an independent vegetation index. It is complementary to, not a substitute for NDVI. Laboratory-measured reflectance spectra of stacked green leaves, and spectral imaging data acquired with Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) over Jasper Ridge in California and the High Plains in northern Colorado, are used to demonstrate the usefulness of NDWI. Comparisons between NDWI and NDVI images are also given.},

  abstract = {Understanding the temporal patterns of leaf traits is critical in determining the seasonality and magnitude of terrestrial carbon, water, and energy fluxes. However, we lack robust and efficient ways to monitor the temporal dynamics of leaf traits. Here we assessed the potential of leaf spectroscopy to predict and monitor leaf traits across their entire life cycle at different forest sites and light environments (sunlit vs. shaded) using a weekly sampled dataset across the entire growing season at two temperate deciduous forests. The dataset includes field measured leaf-level directional-hemispherical reflectance/transmittance together with seven important leaf traits [total chlorophyll (chlorophyll a and b), carotenoids, mass-based nitrogen concentration (Nmass), mass-based carbon concentration (Cmass), and leaf mass per area (LMA)]. All leaf traits varied significantly throughout the growing season, and displayed trait-specific temporal patterns. We used a Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) modeling approach to estimate leaf traits from spectra, and found that PLSR was able to capture the variability across time, sites, and light environments of all leaf traits investigated (R2 = 0.6\textendash{}0.8 for temporal variability; R2 = 0.3\textendash{}0.7 for cross-site variability; R2 = 0.4\textendash{}0.8 for variability from light environments). We also tested alternative field sampling designs and found that for most leaf traits, biweekly leaf sampling throughout the growing season enabled accurate characterization of the seasonal patterns. Compared with the estimation of foliar pigments, the performance of Nmass, Cmass and LMA PLSR models improved more significantly with sampling frequency. Our results demonstrate that leaf spectra-trait relationships vary with time, and thus tracking the seasonality of leaf traits requires statistical models calibrated with data sampled throughout the growing season. Our results have broad implications for future research that use vegetation spectra to infer leaf traits at different growing stages.},

  abstract = {In light of daunting global sustainability challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss and food security, improving our understanding of the complex dynamics of the Earth system is crucial. However, large knowledge gaps related to the effects of land management persist, in particular those human-induced changes in terrestrial ecosystems that do not result in land cover conversions. Here we review the current state of knowledge of ten common land management activities for their biogeochemical and biophysical impacts, the level of process-understanding and data availability. Our review shows that ca. one tenth of the ice free land surface is under intense human management, half under medium and one fifth under extensive management. Based on our review, we cluster these ten management activities into three groups: (1) management activities for which datasets are available, and for which a good knowledge base exists (cropland harvest and irrigation); (2) management activities for which sufficient knowledge on biogeochemical and biophysical effects exists but robust global datasets are lacking (forest harvest, tree species selection, grazing and mowing harvest, N-fertilization); and (3) land management practices with severe data gaps concomitant with an unsatisfactory level of process understanding (crop species selection, artificial wetland drainage, tillage and fire management and crop residue management, an element of crop harvest). Although we identify multiple impediments to progress, we conclude that the current status of process understanding and data availability is sufficient to advance with incorporating management in e.g. Earth System or Dynamic Vegetation models in order to provide a systematic assessment of their role in the Earth system. This review contributes to a strategic prioritization of research efforts across multiple disciplines, including land system research, ecological research and Earth system modelling.

  abstract = {Retrieving leaf chlorophyll content at a range of spatio-temporal scales is central to monitoring vegetation productivity, identifying physiological stress and managing biological resources. However, estimating leaf chlorophyll over broad spatial extents using ground-based traditional methods is time and resource heavy. Satellite-derived spectral vegetation indices (VIs) are commonly used to estimate leaf chlorophyll content, however they are often developed and tested on broadleaf species. Relatively little research has assessed VIs for different leaf structures, particularly needle leaves which represent a large component of boreal forest and significant global ecosystems. This study tested the performance of 47 published VIs for estimating foliar chlorophyll content from different leaf and canopy structures (broadleaf and needle). Coniferous and deciduous sites were selected in Ontario, Canada, representing different dominant vegetation species (Picea mariana and Acer saccharum) and a variety of canopy structures. Leaf reflectance data was collected using an ASD Fieldspec Pro spectroradiometer (400\textendash{}2500 nm) for over 300 leaf samples. Canopy reflectance data was acquired from the medium resolution imaging spectrometer (MERIS). At the canopy level, with both leaf types combined, the DD-index showed the strongest relationship with leaf chlorophyll (R2 = 0.78; RMSE = 3.56 $\mu$g/cm2), despite differences in leaf structure. For needleleaf trees alone the relationship with the top VI was weaker (D[red], R2 = 0.71; RMSE = 2.32 $\mu$g/cm2). A sensitivity study using simulated VIs from physically-modelled leaf (PROSPECT) and canopy (4-Scale) reflectance was performed in order to further investigate these results and assess the impacts of different background types and leaf area index on the VIs' performance. At the leaf level, the MNDVI8 index showed a strong linearity to changing chlorophyll and negligible difference to leaf structure/type. At canopy level, the best performing VIs were relatively consistent where LAI $\geq$ 4, but responded strongly to differences in background at low canopy coverage (LAI = 2). This research provides comprehensive assessments for the use of spectral indices in retrieval of spatially-continuous leaf chlorophyll content at the leaf (MTCI: R2 = 0.72; p \&lt; 0.001) and canopy (DD: R2 = 0.78; p \&lt; 0.001) level for resource management over different spatial and temporal scales.},

There is now growing evidence that intraspecific functional variability, as well as interspecific variability, can have significant effects on community dynamics and ecosystem functioning. A core hypothesis for the use of functional traits expressed as species means, that their intraspecific variability is negligible compared with their interspecific variability, has however been too rarely tested empirically. We then addressed four questions: Is intraspecific functional variability across species ranges negligible compared with interspecific variability? Are the major resource economics trade-off and functional strategies robust to individual trait variability? Are species rankings or ordination robust across species ranges once considering intraspecific variability? Can species be discriminated by their leaf traits? 2.\hspace{0.6em}Using an environmentally stratified sampling design within an alpine catchment, we collected five functional traits for 13 common plant species with contrasting life histories and traits. Several populations from a range of environmental conditions were then sampled for each species across their ranges. 3.\hspace{0.6em}With an original combination of single-trait and multi-trait analyses, we highlighted a non-negligible contribution of intraspecific variability to overall functional trait variability ($\sim$30\%). Although not affecting general and well-known functional trade-offs and strategies, intraspecific functional variability had the potential to alter species ordination and produced a functional continuum rather than a clear-cut species classification. 4.\hspace{0.6em}Deciding whether intraspecific functional variability can be considered as negligible \textendash{} species being represented by mean trait values \textendash, or not \textendash{} species being represented by multivariate trait distributions \textendash, is an essential question for multiple ecological issues.

The presence of certain functional strategies along broad environmental gradients can help to understand the patterns observed in community assembly and the filtering mechanisms that take place. We used a trait-based approach, quantifying variations in aboveground (leaf and stem) and belowground (root) functional traits along environmental gradients in Mediterranean forest communities (south Spain). We proposed a new practical method to quantify the relative importance of species turnover (distinguishing between species occurrence and abundance) versus intraspecific variation, which allowed us to better understand the assemblage rules of these plant communities along environmental gradients. Our results showed that the functional structure of the studied plant communities was highly determined by soil environment. Results from our modelling approach based on maximum likelihood estimators showed a predominant influence of soil water storage on most of the community functional traits. We found that changes in community functional structure along environmental gradients were mainly promoted by species turnover rather than by intraspecific variability. Specifically, our new method of variance decomposition demonstrated that between-site trait variation was the result of changes in species occurrence rather than in the abundance of certain dominant species. In conclusion, this study showed that water availability promoted the predominance of specific trait values (both in above and belowground fractions) associated to a resource acquisition or conservation strategy. In addition, we provided evidence that changes on community functional structure along the environmental gradient were mainly promoted by a process of species replacement, which represent a crucial step towards a more general understanding of the relative importance of intraspecific versus interspecific trait variation in these woody Mediterranean communities.},

  abstract = {Satellite and airborne optical sensors are increasingly used by scientists, and policy makers, and managers for studying and managing forests, agriculture crops, and urban areas. Their data acquired with given instrumental specifications (spectral resolution, viewing direction, sensor field-of-view, etc.) and for a specific experimental configuration (surface and atmosphere conditions, sun direction, etc.) are commonly translated into qualitative and quantitative Earth surface parameters. However, atmosphere properties and Earth surface 3D architecture often confound their interpretation. Radiative transfer models capable of simulating the Earth and atmosphere complexity are, therefore, ideal tools for linking remotely sensed data to the surface parameters. Still, many existing models are oversimplifying the Earth-atmosphere system interactions and their parameterization of sensor specifications is often neglected or poorly considered. The Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model is one of the most comprehensive physically based 3D models simulating the Earth-atmosphere radiation interaction from visible to thermal infrared wavelengths. It has been developed since 1992. It models optical signals at the entrance of imaging radiometers and laser scanners on board of satellites and airplanes, as well as the 3D radiative budget, of urban and natural landscapes for any experimental configuration and instrumental specification. It is freely distributed for research and teaching activities. This paper presents DART physical bases and its latest functionality for simulating imaging spectroscopy of natural and urban landscapes with atmosphere, including the perspective projection of airborne acquisitions and LIght Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) waveform and photon counting signals.},

In 2004, a paper by Wright et al. comparing six leaf traits of over 2000 plant species showed that between-species variation among the traits was confined primarily to a single multidimensional axis, but only if traits were normalized by leaf mass. This ``leaf economic spectrum'' has been influential in guiding understanding of the roles of plants in global carbon cycling. Osnas et al. (p. 741, published online 28 March) now show that the principal finding of Wright et al. is primarily a mathematical consequence of the way that the data were normalized. Analysis of the same data suggests that traits are primarily proportional to leaf area, not leaf mass. Using a method to analyze relationships among traits without normalization-induced correlations revealed a multidimensional correlation between leaf traits. These relationships imply weaker effects of leaf nitrogen on rates of photosynthesis and respiration, with important implications for current models of global change.
The leaf economics spectrum (LES) describes multivariate correlations that constrain leaf traits of plant species primarily to a single axis of variation if data are normalized by leaf mass. We show that these traits are approximately distributed proportional to leaf area instead of mass, as expected for a light- and carbon dioxide\textendash{}collecting organ. Much of the structure in the mass-normalized LES results from normalizing area-proportional traits by mass. Mass normalization induces strong correlations among area-proportional traits because of large variation among species in leaf mass per area (LMA). The high LMA variance likely reflects its functional relationship with leaf life span. A LES that is independent of mass- or area-normalization and LMA reveals physiological relationships that are inconsistent with those in global vegetation models designed to address climate change.
Leaf traits are distributed in proportion to area; relationships between leaf traits are independent of leaf mass and area.

  abstract = {There is a spectrum from species with narrow, frequently branched twigs carrying small leaves and other appendages, to species with thick twigs carrying large leaves and appendages. Here we investigate the allometry of this spectrum and its relationship to two other important spectra of ecological variation between species, the seed mass\textemdash{}seed output spectrum and the specific leaf area\textemdash{}leaf lifespan spectrum. Our main dataset covered 33 woody dicotyledonous species in sclerophyll fire-prone vegetation on low nutrient soil at 1,200 mm annual rainfall near Sydney, Australia. These were phylogenetically selected to contribute 32 evolutionary divergences. Two smaller datasets, from 390 mm annual rainfall, were also examined to assess generality of cross-species patterns. There was two to three orders of magnitude variation in twig cross-sectional area, individual leaf size and total leaf area supported on a twig across the study species. As expected, species with thicker twigs had larger leaves and branched less often than species with thin twigs. Total leaf area supported on a twig was mainly driven by leaf size rather than by the number of leaves. Total leaf area was strongly correlated with twig cross-section area, both across present-day species and across evolutionary divergences. The common log-log slope of 1.45 was significantly steeper than 1. Thus on average, species with tenfold larger leaves supported about threefold more leaf area per twig cross-section, which must have considerable implications for other aspects of water relations. Species at the low rainfall site on loamy sand supported about half as much leaf area, at a given twig cross-section, as species at the low rainfall site on light clay, or at the high rainfall site. Within sites, leaf and twig size were positively correlated with seed mass, and negatively correlated with specific leaf area. Identifying and understanding leading spectra of ecological variation among species is an important challenge for plant ecology. The seed mass\textemdash{}seed output and specific leaf area\textemdash{}leaf lifespan spectra are each underpinned by a single, comprehensible trade-off and their consequences are fairly well understood. The leaf-size-twig-size spectrum has obvious consequences for the texture of canopies, but we are only just beginning to understand the costs and benefits of large versus small leaf and twig size.},

  abstract = {Extraction of information from remotely sensed images would greatly benefit from increased use of spatial data. However, the utility of spatial data has been undermined by a lack of understanding of the nature and causes of observed spatial variation in images. One approach to this problem is to model the spatial variation in images as a function of ground scene and sensor parameters. Variograms are the tool used to link models of ground scenes to spatial variation in images. Explicit variograms are calculated for simple models of ground scenes consisting of randomly located discs on a continuous background. By incorporating the effect of the IFOV of the sensor through a process called regularization, explicit variograms for images of these scene models are derived. Verification of the explicit variograms is accomplished by simulating images that match the assumed scene model and sensor parameters and calculating empirical variograms for these images. For a simple scene model of randomly located discs on a continuous background, explicit and empirical variograms match, verifying the convergence of these two dissimilar approaches. The sensitivity of variograms is studied through varying parameters of scene models both in calculating explicit variograms and in simulating images. Results indicate direct ties between several scene parameters and the behavior of variograms. The height of the sill of the variogram is related to the density of objects. The range of influence is related to the size of objects. Increased variance in the size distribution of objects results in a more rounded shape in the variogram near the sill. Primary effects of increasing the units of regularization, or larger pixel size, are a decrease in the height of the sill and an increase in the range of influence.},

  abstract = {1. Trade-offs among functional traits reveal major plant strategies that can give insight into species distributions and ecosystem processes. However, current identification of plant strategies lacks the integration of root structural traits together with leaf and stem traits. 2. We examined correlations among 14 traits representing leaf, stem and woody root tissues. Traits were measured on 1084 individuals representing 758 Neotropical tree species, across 13 sites representative of the environmental variation encompassed by three widespread habitats (seasonally flooded, clay terra firme and white-sand forests) at opposite ends of Amazonia (French Guiana and Peru). 3. Woody root traits were closely aligned with stem traits, but not with leaf traits. Altogether leaf, stem and woody root traits delineated two orthogonal axes of functional trade-offs: a first axis defined by leaf traits, corresponding to a `leaf economics spectrum', and a second axis defined by covarying stem and woody root traits, corresponding to a `wood economics spectrum'. These axes remained consistent when accounting for species evolutionary history with phylogenetically independent contrasts. 4. Despite the strong species turnover across sites, the covariation among root and stem structural traits as well as their orthogonality to leaf traits were strongly consistent across habitats and regions. 5. We conclude that root structural traits mirrored stem traits rather than leaf traits in Neotropical trees. Leaf and wood traits define an integrated whole-plant strategy in lowland South American forests that may contribute to a more complete understanding of plant responses to global changes in both correlative and modelling approaches. We suggest further meta-analyses in expanded environmental and geographic zones to determine the generality of this pattern.},

  abstract = {Robust yet simple remote sensing methodologies for mapping instantaneous land-surface fluxes of water, energy and CO2 exchange within a coupled framework add significant value to large-scale monitoring networks like FLUXNET, facilitating upscaling of tower flux observations to address questions of regional carbon cycling and water availability. This study investigates the implementation of an analytical, light-use efficiency (LUE) based model of canopy resistance within a Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) scheme driven primarily by thermal remote sensing inputs. The LUE model computes coupled canopy-scale carbon assimilation and transpiration fluxes, and replaces a Priestley\textendash{}Taylor (PT) based transpiration estimate used in the original form of the TSEB model. In turn, the thermal remote sensing data provide valuable diagnostic information about the sub-surface moisture status, obviating the need for precipitation input data and prognostic modeling of the soil water balance. Both the LUE and PT forms of the model are compared with eddy covariance tower measurements acquired in rangeland near El Reno, OK. The LUE method resulted in improved partitioning of the surface energy budget, capturing effects of midday stomatal closure in response to increased vapor pressure deficit and reducing errors in half-hourly flux predictions from 16 to 12\%. The spatial distribution of CO2 flux was mapped over the El Reno study area using data from an airborne thermal imaging system and compared to fluxes measured by an aircraft flying a transect over rangeland, riparian areas, and harvested winter wheat. Soil respiration contributions to the net carbon flux were modeled spatially using remotely sensed estimates of soil surface temperature, soil moisture, and leaf area index. Modeled carbon and water fluxes from this heterogeneous landscape compared well in magnitude and spatial pattern to the aircraft fluxes. The thermal inputs proved to be valuable in modifying the effective LUE from a nominal species-dependent value. The model associates cooler canopy temperatures with enhanced transpiration, indicating higher canopy conductance and carbon assimilation rates. The surface energy balance constraint in this modeling approach provides a useful and physically intuitive mechanism for incorporating subtle signatures of soil moisture deficiencies and reduced stomatal aperture, manifest in the thermal band signal, into the coupled carbon and water flux estimates.},

  abstract = {Forthcoming superspectral satellite missions dedicated to land monitoring, as well as planned imaging spectrometers, will unleash an unprecedented data stream. The processing requirements for such large data streams involve processing techniques enabling the spatio-temporally explicit quantification of vegetation properties. Typically retrieval must be accurate, robust and fast. Hence, there is a strict requirement to identify next-generation bio-geophysical variable retrieval algorithms which can be molded into an operational processing chain. This paper offers a review of state-of-the-art retrieval methods for quantitative terrestrial bio-geophysical variable extraction using optical remote sensing imagery. We can categorize these methods into (1) parametric regression, (2) non-parametric regression, (3) physically-based and (4) hybrid methods. Hybrid methods combine generic capabilities of physically-based methods with flexible and computationally efficient methods, typically non-parametric regression methods. A review of the theoretical basis of all these methods is given first and followed by published applications. This paper focusses on: (1) retrievability of bio-geophysical variables, (2) ability to generate multiple outputs, (3) possibilities for model transparency description, (4) mapping speed, and (5) possibilities for uncertainty retrieval. Finally, the prospects of implementing these methods into future processing chains for operational retrieval of vegetation properties are presented and discussed.},

  abstract = {Soil fertility is one of the major drivers of ecological processes and is therefore frequently investigated in ecological research. Although often referred to in studies, soil fertility is not well quantified. Consequently some studies have resorted to classifying site soil fertility according to the potential fertility associated with underlying geology, ignoring the soil nutrient status of the rootzone. A common protocol is for ecologists to sample the upper soil layers only (\&lt;20~cm). Unfortunately these surface layers are those most likely to be altered by the vegetation itself and may not necessarily reflect the influence of the geological substrate. Using examples, we attempt to provide some practical guidelines on how to determine the intrinsic nutrient status of soils. Soil data from five sites in southern African savannas were used to demonstrate: a) when deeper soil sampling may not be needed, b) how to determine which nutrients may be limiting at a site, c) the importance of bulk density measurements and d) the effect of three different sampling methods. Our data illustrate that the effects of fine scale landscape variability on soil nutrients were evident to variable soil depths. Frequent fires affected soils only to depths of \&lt;5~cm, the presence of tree canopies affected soils up to 50~cm, while topographic position affected soil nutrients to a depth of 90~cm. Bulk density did not differ between depths nor between treatments within sites, but differed amongst sites. None of the alternative methods used to collect soil samples (i.e. augering vs. digging soil pits and sampling by depth or horizon) resulted in significant differences in nutrient measures. Standardised sampling from at least three depths together with bulk density measurements allow for calculation of nutrient stocks as a measure of intrinsic soil nutrient status, while also providing insights into nutrient distributions with depth, thereby allowing meaningful cross-site comparisons.},

  abstract = {Improving the accuracy of estimates of forest carbon exchange is a central priority for understanding ecosystem response to increased atmospheric CO2 levels and improving carbon cycle modeling. However, the spatially-continuous parameterization of photosynthetic capacity (Vcmax) at global scales and appropriate temporal intervals within terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) remains unresolved. This research investigates the use of biochemical parameters for modelling leaf photosynthetic capacity within a deciduous forest. Particular attention is given to the impacts of seasonality on both leaf biophysical variables and physiologic processes, and their inter-dependent relationships. Four deciduous tree species were sampled across three growing seasons (2013-2015), approximately every 10 days for leaf chlorophyll content (ChlLeaf) and canopy structure. Leaf nitrogen (NArea) was also measured during 2014. Leaf photosynthesis was measured during 2014-15 using a Li-6400 gas-exchange system, with A-Ci curves to model Vcmax. Results showed that seasonality and variations between species resulted in weak relationships between Vcmax normalised to 25$^\circ$C (Vcmax25) and NArea (R2 = 0.62, p$<$0.001), whereas ChlLeaf demonstrated a much stronger correlation with Vcmax25 (R2 = 0.78, p$<$0.001). The relationship between ChlLeaf and NArea was also weak (R2 = 0.47, p$<$0.001), possibly due to the dynamic partitioning of nitrogen, between and within photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic fractions. The spatial and temporal variability of Vcmax25 was mapped using Landsat TM/ETM satellite data across the forest site, using physical models to derive ChlLeaf. TBMs largely treat photosynthetic parameters as either fixed constants, or varying according to leaf nitrogen content. This research challenges assumptions that simple NArea-Vcmax25 relationships can reliably be used to constrain photosynthetic capacity in TBMs, even within the same plant functional type. It is suggested that ChlLeaf provides a more accurate, direct proxy for Vcmax25 and is also more easily retrievable from satellite data. These results have important implications for carbon modelling within deciduous ecosystems. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

We tested whether plant species richness, functional group richness or the presence/absence of particular plant functional groups influences the Si and Ca concentrations (mmol g-1) and stocks (mmol m-2) in aboveground plant biomass in a large grassland biodiversity experiment (Jena Experiment). In the experiment including 60 temperate grassland species, plant diversity was manipulated as sown species richness (1, 2, 4, 8, 16) and richness and identity of plant functional groups (1\textendash{}4; grasses, small herbs, tall herbs, legumes). We found positive species richness effects on Si as well as Ca stocks that were attributable to increased biomass production. The presence of particular functional groups was the most important factor explaining variation in aboveground Si and Ca stocks (mmol m-2). Grass presence increased the Si stocks by 140 \% and legume presence increased the Ca stock by 230 \%. Both the presence of specific plant functional groups and species diversity altered Si and Ca stocks, whereas Si and Ca concentration were affected mostly by the presence of specific plant functional groups. However, we found a negative effect of species diversity on Si and Ca accumulation, by calculating the deviation between mixtures and mixture biomass proportions, but in monoculture concentrations. These changes may in turn affect ecosystem processes such as plant litter decomposition and nutrient cycling in grasslands.},

Here we propose that plant functional traits, as determinants of species performance, may be useful tools for quantifying species niche parameters over environmental gradients.
Important findings Under this framework, the mean trait values of a species determine its niche position along gradients, and intraspecific trait variability determines its niche breadth. This trait-based approach can provide an operational assessment of niche for a potentially large number of species, making it possible to understand and predict species niche shifts under environmental changes. We further advocate a promising method that recently appeared in the literature, which partitions trait diversity into among- and within-community components as a way to quantify the species niche in units of traits instead of environmental parameters. This approach allows the switch of the focus from ecological niches to trait niches, facilitating the examination of species coexistence along undefined environmental gradients. Altogether, the trait-based approach provides a promising toolkit for quantifying the species ecological niche and for understanding the evolution of species niche and traits.},

  abstract = {Imaging spectroscopy, also known as hyperspectral remote sensing, is based on the characterization of Earth surface materials and processes through spectrally-resolved measurements of the light interacting with matter. The potential of imaging spectroscopy for Earth remote sensing has been demonstrated since the 1980s. However, most of the developments and applications in imaging spectroscopy have largely relied on airborne spectrometers, as the amount and quality of space-based imaging spectroscopy data remain relatively low to date. The upcoming Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) German imaging spectroscopy mission is intended to fill this gap. An overview of the main characteristics and current status of the mission is provided in this contribution. The core payload of EnMAP consists of a dual-spectrometer instrument measuring in the optical spectral range between 420 and 2450 nm with a spectral sampling distance varying between 5 and 12 nm and a reference signal-to-noise ratio of 400:1 in the visible and near-infrared and 180:1 in the shortwave-infrared parts of the spectrum. EnMAP images will cover a 30 km-wide area in the across-track direction with a ground sampling distance of 30 m. An across-track tilted observation capability will enable a target revisit time of up to four days at the Equator and better at high latitudes. EnMAP will contribute to the development and exploitation of spaceborne imaging spectroscopy applications by making high-quality data freely available to scientific users worldwide.},

  abstract = {The terrestrial carbon cycle is currently the least constrained component of the global carbon budget. Large uncertainties stem from a poor understanding of plant carbon allocation, stocks, residence times, and carbon use efficiency. Imposing observational constraints on the terrestrial carbon cycle and its processes is, therefore, necessary to better understand its current state and predict its future state. We combine a diagnostic ecosystem carbon model with satellite observations of leaf area and biomass (where and when available) and soil carbon data to retrieve the first global estimates, to our knowledge, of carbon cycle state and process variables at a 1$^\circ$ \texttimes{} 1$^\circ$ resolution; retrieved variables are independent from the plant functional type and steady-state paradigms. Our results reveal global emergent relationships in the spatial distribution of key carbon cycle states and processes. Live biomass and dead organic carbon residence times exhibit contrasting spatial features (r = 0.3). Allocation to structural carbon is highest in the wet tropics (85\textendash{}88\%) in contrast to higher latitudes (73\textendash{}82\%), where allocation shifts toward photosynthetic carbon. Carbon use efficiency is lowest (0.42\textendash{}0.44) in the wet tropics. We find an emergent global correlation between retrievals of leaf mass per leaf area and leaf lifespan (r = 0.64\textendash{}0.80) that matches independent trait studies. We show that conventional land cover types cannot adequately describe the spatial variability of key carbon states and processes (multiple correlation median = 0.41). This mismatch has strong implications for the prediction of terrestrial carbon dynamics, which are currently based on globally applied parameters linked to land cover or plant functional types.},

  abstract = {Background and aims Tropical forests contribute significantly to the global carbon cycle, yet the relative importance of tree diversity on key ecosystem processes such as root decomposition remains unknown. Methods We examined the influence of tree species richness on root decomposition over 485 days at two sites in Panama with contrasting soil fertility. Diversity effects on decomposition rates were calculated where 1) overstory tree species richness and composition matched that occurring inside root decomposition bags and 2) where roots of contrasting species richness decomposed under a common tree overstory. In addition, we tested 27 root traits to identify those that contribute to predict root decomposition in tropical forests. Results Tree species richness did not affect root decomposition rates, neither when species were manipulated within bags nor with varying tree overstory richness. Root carbon quality and micronutrient concentrations such as manganese explained 47 and 81 \% of the variation in decomposition rates in the fertile and infertile site, respectively, demonstrating that the relative importance of traits was modulated by the soil environment. Conclusions Our results suggest that root decomposition in tropical forests is mediated by root functional composition and the soil environment rather than by species richness.},

  abstract = {Global vegetation distribution is the result of environmental conditions and the genetic make-up of plants. In view of the intensive discussions on climate change and its effect on living organisms on earth, it has become necessary to develop new methods and strategies to monitor and follow the changes in global plant distribution.

In this research, we focused on a vegetation analysis using spectral reflectance profiles linked to biochemical concentrations. We performed the spectroscopic measurements of Pistacia species at canopy and leaf levels. Concomitant chemical analyses of leaf and bark materials enabled the development of remote sensing (RS) indices of structure-related biochemicals and pigments. We developed RS indices for cellulose, lignin, chlorophyll, carotenoid, anthocyanin and wax. Since the wax was the least studied in this context and due to the fact that it is the first layer of the plant surface that interacts with the incident light, it deserved special attention and was assumed to affect the spectral reflectance and, in combination with the other biochemicals, to contribute to better species identification.

In the modeling process, we showed that apart from the major energy absorption spectral bands related to a given biochemical, there were supplementary bands that had a significant effect on the accuracy of the biochemical content estimation. Another factor affecting the accuracy of the biochemical estimation was the season. Thus, we divided the biochemical content estimation models into seasonal groups of spring, summer and fall. The RS indices developed in this work, together with literature-reported RS indices, were used for Pistacia classification. The accuracy (69\%) of species classification was significantly higher in spring at an early vegetation stage than in summer (50\%), and fall (37\%). As a proof of concept, the same sets of RS indices were also used for classifying the genera and families of various plants in the Mediterranean forest using EO1 Hyperion images. The accuracy of the classification maps was 79\%, when the full set of RS indices developed in this work was used.},

  abstract = {Photosynthesis is the process by which plants harvest sunlight to produce sugars from carbon dioxide and water. It is the primary source of energy for all life on Earth; hence it is important to understand how this process responds to climate change and human impact. However, model-based estimates of gross primary production (GPP, output from photosynthesis) are highly uncertain, in particular over heavily managed agricultural areas. Recent advances in spectroscopy enable the space-based monitoring of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from terrestrial plants. Here we demonstrate that spaceborne SIF retrievals provide a direct measure of the GPP of cropland and grassland ecosystems. Such a strong link with crop photosynthesis is not evident for traditional remotely sensed vegetation indices, nor for more complex carbon cycle models. We use SIF observations to provide a global perspective on agricultural productivity. Our SIF-based crop GPP estimates are 50\textendash{}75\% higher than results from state-of-the-art carbon cycle models over, for example, the US Corn Belt and the Indo-Gangetic Plain, implying that current models severely underestimate the role of management. Our results indicate that SIF data can help us improve our global models for more accurate projections of agricultural productivity and climate impact on crop yields. Extension of our approach to other ecosystems, along with increased observational capabilities for SIF in the near future, holds the prospect of reducing uncertainties in the modeling of the current and future carbon cycle.},

  abstract = {Understanding the context dependence of ecosystem responses to global changes requires the development of new conceptual frameworks. Here we propose a framework for considering how tree species and their mycorrhizal associates differentially couple carbon (C) and nutrient cycles in temperate forests. Given that tree species predominantly associate with a single type of mycorrhizal fungi (arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi or ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi), and that the two types of fungi differ in their modes of nutrient acquisition, we hypothesize that the abundance of AM and ECM trees in a plot, stand, or region may provide an integrated index of biogeochemical transformations relevant to C cycling and nutrient retention. First, we describe how forest plots dominated by AM tree species have nutrient economies that differ in their C\textendash{}nutrient couplings from those in plots dominated by ECM trees. Secondly, we demonstrate how the relative abundance of AM and ECM trees can be used to estimate nutrient dynamics across the landscape. Finally, we describe how our framework can be used to generate testable hypotheses about forest responses to global change factors, and how these dynamics can be used to develop better representations of plant\textendash{}soil feedbacks and nutrient constraints on productivity in ecosystem and earth system models.},

  doi = {10.1111/oik.03869},
  abstract = {Recent studies have shown that the diversity of flowering plants can enhance pollinator richness and visitation frequency and thereby increase the resilience of pollination. It is assumed that flower traits explain these effects, but it is still unclear which flower traits are responsible, and knowing that, if pollinator richness and visitation frequency are more driven by mass-ratio effects (mean trait values) or by trait diversity. Here, we analyse a three-year data set of pollinator observations collected in a European grassland plant diversity experiment (The Jena experiment). The data entail comprehensive flower trait measurements, including reward traits (nectar and pollen amount), morphological traits (height, symmetry, area, colour spectra), and chemical traits (nectar-amino acid and nectar-sugar concentration). We test if pollinator species richness and visitation frequency of flower communities depend on overall functional diversity combining all flower traits within a community, single trait diversities (within trait variation) and community-weighted means of the single traits, using Bayesian inference. Overall functional diversity did not affect pollinator species richness, but reduced visitation frequency. When looking at individual flower traits separately, we found that single trait diversity of flower reflectance and flower morphology were important predictors of pollinator visitation frequency. Moreover, independent of total flower abundance, community-weighted means of flower height, area, reflectance, nectar-sugar concentration and nectar-amino acid concentration strongly affected both pollinator species richness and visitation frequency. Our results, challenge the idea that functional diversity always positively affects ecosystem functions. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that both single trait diversity and mass-ratio effects of flower traits play an important role for diverse and frequent flower visits, which underlines the functionality of flower traits for pollination services.

  abstract = {Summary. We consider the problem of comparing complex hierarchical models in which the number of parameters is not clearly defined. Using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure pD for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. In general pD approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher's information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the `hat' matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. Its properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding pD to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. The procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals. Throughout it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.},

  abstract = {* Average responses of forest foliar traits to elevation are well understood, but far less is known about trait distributional responses to elevation at multiple ecological scales. This limits our understanding of the ecological scales at which trait variation occurs in response to environmental drivers and change.

* We analyzed and compared multiple canopy foliar trait distributions using field sampling and airborne imaging spectroscopy along an Andes-to-Amazon elevation gradient. Field-estimated traits were generated from three community-weighting methods, and remotely sensed estimates of traits were made at three scales defined by sampling grain size and ecological extent.

* Field and remote sensing approaches revealed increases in average leaf mass per unit area (LMA), water, nonstructural carbohydrates (NSCs) and polyphenols with increasing elevation. Foliar nutrients and photosynthetic pigments displayed little to no elevation trend. Sample weighting approaches had little impact on field-estimated trait responses to elevation. Plot representativeness of trait distributions at landscape scales decreased with increasing elevation. Remote sensing indicated elevation-dependent increases in trait variance and distributional skew.

* Multiscale invariance of LMA, leaf water and NSC mark these traits as candidates for tracking forest responses to changing climate. Trait-based ecological studies can be greatly enhanced with multiscale studies made possible by imaging spectroscopy.},

To provide mechanistic insight into the rules governing plant species co-existence and diversity, plant community ecologists are increasingly quantifying functional trait values for the species found in a wide range of communities. 2.\hspace{0.6em}Despite the promise of a quantitative functional trait approach to plant community ecology, we suggest that, along with examining trait variation across species, an assessment of trait variation within species should also be a key component of a trait-based approach to community ecology. Variability within and between individuals and populations is likely widespread due to plastic responses to highly localized abiotic and biotic interactions. 3.\hspace{0.6em}In this study, we quantify leaf trait variation within and across ten co-existing tree species in a dry tropical forest in Costa Rica to ask: (i) whether the majority of trait variation is located between species, within species, within individuals or within the leaves themselves; (ii) whether trait values collected using standardized methods correlate with those collected using unstandardized methods; and (iii) to what extent can we differentiate plant species on the basis of their traits? 4.\hspace{0.6em}We find that the majority of variation in traits was often explained by between species differences; however, between leaflet trait variation was very high for compound-leaved species. We also show that many species are difficult to reliably differentiate on the basis of functional traits even when sampling many individuals. 5.\hspace{0.6em}We suggest an ideal sample size of at least 10, and ideally 20, individuals be used when calculating mean trait values for individual species for entire communities, though even at large sample sizes, it remains unclear if community level trait values will allow comparisons on a larger geographic scale or if species traits are generally similar across scales. It will thus be critical to account for intraspecific variation by comparing species mean trait values across space in multiple microclimatic environments within local communities and along environmental gradients. Further, quantifying trait variability due to plasticity and inheritance will provide a better understanding of the underlying patterns and drivers of trait variation as well as the application of functional traits in outlining mechanisms of species co-existence.},

In one extreme, warm SSTA peak near the South American coast (often referred to as Eastern Pacific of EP El Ni{\~n}o), and at the other extreme, warm SSTA peak in the central Pacific (Central Pacific or CP El Ni{\~n}o). Due to the differing tropical Pacific SSTA and precipitation structure, there are differing extratropical responses, particularly over North America. Recent work involving the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) system for intra-seasonal to inter-annual prediction on prediction of the differences between El Ni{\~n}o events found excess warming in the eastern Pacific during CP El Ni{\~n}o events. This manuscript investigates the ensemble and observational agreement of the NMME system when forecasting the North American response to the diversity of ENSO, focusing on regional land-based 2-meter temperature and precipitation. NMME forecasts of North American precipitation and T2m agree with observations more often during EP events. Ensemble agreement of NMME forecasts is regional. For instance, ensemble agreement in Southeast North America demonstrates a strong connection to NINO3 precipitation and SSTA amplitude during warm ENSO events. Ensemble agreement in Northwest North America demonstrates a weak connection to NINO4 precipitation and SSTA amplitude during warm ENSO events. Still other regions do not show a strong connection between ensemble agreement and strength of warm ENSO events.},

  abstract = {Accurate temporal and spatial measurements of leaf optical traits (i.e., absorption, reflectance and transmittance) are paramount to photosynthetic studies. These optical traits are also needed to couple radiative transfer and physiological models to facilitate the interpretation of optical data. However, estimating leaf optical traits in leaves with complex morphologies remains a challenge. Leaf optical traits can be measured using integrating spheres, either by placing the leaf sample in one of the measuring ports (External Method) or by placing the sample inside the sphere (Internal Method). However, in leaves with complex morphology (e.g., needles), the External Method presents limitations associated with gaps between the leaves, and the Internal Method presents uncertainties related to the estimation of total leaf area. We introduce a modified version of the Internal Method, which bypasses the effect of gaps and the need to estimate total leaf area, by painting the leaves black and measuring them before and after painting. We assess and compare the new method with the External Method using a broadleaf and two conifer species. Both methods yielded similar leaf absorption estimates for the broadleaf, but absorption estimates were higher with the External Method for the conifer species. Factors explaining the differences between methods, their trade-offs and their advantages and limitations are also discussed. We suggest that the new method can be used to estimate leaf absorption in any type of leaf independently of its morphology, and be used to study further the impact of gap fraction in the External Method.},

We hypothesized that compositional changes during succession in dry forest were mainly determined by increasing water availability leading to community functional changes from conservative to acquisitive strategies, and in wet forest by decreasing light availability leading to changes from acquisitive to conservative strategies. Research was carried out in 15 dry secondary forest plots (5\textendash{}63 years after abandonment) and 17 wet secondary forest plots ($<$1\textendash{}25 years after abandonment). Community-level functional traits were represented by community-weighted means based on 11 functional traits measured on 132 species. Successional changes in functional composition are more marked in dry forest than in wet forest and largely characterized by different traits. During dry forest succession, conservative traits related to drought tolerance and drought avoidance decreased, as predicted. Unexpectedly acquisitive leaf traits also decreased, whereas seed size and dependence on biotic dispersal increased. In wet forest succession, functional composition changed from acquisitive to conservative leaf traits, suggesting light availability as the main driver of changes. Distinct suites of traits shape functional composition changes in dry and wet forest succession, responding to different environmental filters.},

  abstract = {Plant trait data have been used in various studies related to ecosystem functioning, community ecology, and assessment of ecosystem services. Evidences are that plant scientists agree on a set of key plant traits, which are relatively easy to measure and have a stable and strong predictive response to ecosystem functions. However, the field measurements of plant trait data are still limited to small area, to a certain moment in time and to certain number of species only. Therefore, remote sensing (RS) offers potential to complement or even replace field measurements of some plant traits. It offers instantaneous spatially contiguous information, covers larger areas and in case of satellite observations profits from their revisit capacity.

In this review, we first introduce RS concepts of light\textendash{}vegetation interactions, RS instruments for vegetation studies, RS methods, and scaling between field and RS observations. Further we discuss in detail current achievements and challenges of optical RS for mapping of key plant traits. We concentrate our discussion on three categorical plant traits (plant growth and life forms, flammability properties and photosynthetic pathways and activity) and on five continuous plant traits (plant height, leaf phenology, leaf mass per area, nitrogen and phosphorous concentration or content). We review existing literature to determine the retrieval accuracy of the continuous plant traits. The relative estimation error using RS ranged between 10\% and 45\% of measured mean value, i.e. around 10\% for plant height of tall canopies, 20\% for plant height of short canopies, 15\% for plant nitrogen, 25\% for plant phosphorus content/concentration, and 45\% for leaf mass per area estimates.

The potential of RS to map plant traits is particularly high when traits are related to leaf biochemistry, photosynthetic processes and canopy structure. There are also other plant traits, i.e. leaf chlorophyll content, water content and leaf area index, which can be retrieved from optical RS well and can be of importance for plant scientists.

We underline the need that future assessments of ecosystem functioning using RS should require comprehensive and integrated measurements of various plant traits together with leaf and canopy spectral properties. By doing so, the interplay between plant structural, physiological, biochemical, phenological and spectral properties can be better understood.},

  abstract = {The seasonality of solar irradiance and precipitation may regulate seasonal variations in tropical forests carbon cycling. Controversy remains over their importance as drivers of seasonal dynamics of net primary productivity in tropical forests. We use ground data from nine lowland Amazonian forest plots collected over three years to quantify the monthly NPP of leaves, reproductive material, woody material, and fine roots over an annual cycle. We distinguish between forests that do not experience substantial seasonal moisture stress (``humid sites'') and forests that experience a stronger dry season (``dry sites''). We find that forests from both precipitation regimes maximise leaf NPP over the drier season, with a peak in production in August at both humid (mean 0.39\,$\pm$\,0.03\,Mg C ha-1 mo-1 in July, n\,=\,4) and dry sites (mean 0.49\,$\pm$\,0.03\,Mg C ha-1 mo-1 in September, n\,=\,8). We identify two distinct seasonal carbon allocation patterns (the allocation of NPP to a specific organ such as wood leaves or fine roots divided by total NPP). The forests monitored in the present study show evidence of either: (i) constant allocation to roots and a seasonal trade-off between leaf and woody material; or (ii) constant allocation to wood and a seasonal trade-off between roots and leaves. Finally, we find strong evidence of synchronised flowering at the end of the dry season in both precipitation regimes. Flower production reaches a maximum of 0.047\,$\pm$\,0.013 and 0.031\,$\pm$\,0.004\,Mg C ha-1 mo-1 in November, in humid and dry sites respectively. Fruitfall production was staggered throughout the year, probably reflecting the high variation in varying times to development and loss of fruit amongst species.},

  abstract = {Northern white cedar (Thuja occidentalis L.) stands throughout the upper Midwestern United States have failed to recruit individuals to the canopy consistently for several decades. To examine local and landscape factors that influence cedar regeneration we recorded the abundance of cedar seedlings and saplings in 24 lowland cedar stands in the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest, Wisconsin, during summer 2001. Cedar seedlings (height $<$22 cm) were common (median $\mkern1mu$=$\mkern1mu$ 1800 ha-1), but the largest size class (height $\geq$100 cm) was extremely rare ($\sim$1 ha-1) and heavily browsed. We used information-theoretic model averaging of linear mixed-effects models to identify local and landscape variables important for predicting the density of seedlings and saplings. The density of newly germinated seedlings was higher along transects farther from roads and with more mature cedar. Large seedling and small sapling densities were higher along transects with open canopies located in landscapes with a higher ratio of deciduous to coniferous forest. Increased edge-to-area ratios of cedar stands and edge density of the surrounding forest were associated with lower densities of large seedlings and small saplings, respectively. Results indicated a strong demographic effect with the density of large size classes being strongly dependent on the density of smaller size classes. Because the landscape factors considered are linked to browsing intensity, a reduction in deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmermann) density coupled with landscape-sensitive forest management may help to foster cedar regeneration in northern Wisconsin.},

  abstract = {A two-stream approximation model of radiative transfer is used to calculate values of hemispheric canopy reflectance in the visible and near-infrared wavelength intervals. Simple leaf models of photosynthesis and stomatal resistance are integrated over leaf orientation and canopy depth to obtain estimates of canopy photosynthesis and bulk stomatal or canopy resistance. The simple ratio (SR) of the near-infrared and visible canopy reflectances has been found to be a near-linear indicator of the photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the canopy, APAR, minimum canopy resistance, 1/rc, and photosynthetic capacity Pc, but a highly nonlinear and therefore less reliable predictor of leaf area index or biomass (Sellers, 1985). This paper extends previous work and investigates the biophysical processes giving rise to the near-linear dependence of APAR, Pc, and 1/rc, on SR. It is demonstrated that under normal field conditions, i.e., dark soil, the near-infrared reflectance term controls the variation of SR with leaf area index. As a result of this, near-linearly between SR and APAR, Pr or 1/rc will occur if the leaf scattering coefficient in the near-infrared region, $\omega$N, satisfies the following equality: $\omega$N = 1 - [G($\mu$)/2$\mu$]2(1 - $\omega\pi$), where $\omega\pi$ is the leaf's effective scattering coefficient for PAR, G($\mu$) is the average leaf projection in the direction $\mu$ and $\mu$ is the cosine of the zenith angle of the incoming flux. This condition is approximately met in nature. It is shown that a variety of satellite sensor combinations are well configured for the estimation of APAR, Pc and 1/rc by responding to leaf scattering coefficients in bands that conform to the above expression. The relationships between SR and APAR, Pc, or 1/rc becomes increasingly nonlinear as the soil reflectivity increases.},

  abstract = {Species variation in functional traits may reflect diversification relating to convergence and/or divergence depending on environmental pressures and phylogenetic history. We tested trait-environment relationships and their basis in finer-scale evolutionary processes among nine extant Hawaiian species of Scaevola L. (Goodeniaceae), a taxon with a complex history of three independent colonizations by different phylogenetic lineages, parallel ecological specialization, and homoploid hybridization events in Hawai`i. Using a wild population for each species, we evaluated traits related to plant function (morphology, leaf and wood anatomy, nutrient and carbon isotope composition). Hawaiian Scaevola species were distributed across coastal, dry forest and wet forest environments; multivariate environmental analysis using abiotic and biotic factors further showed that species from distantly related lineages inhabited similar environments. Many traits correlated with environment (based on the multivariate environmental analysis), considering both distantly related species and more closely related species. Scaevola species within shared habitats generally showed trait convergence across distantly related lineages, particularly among wet forest species. Furthermore, trait diversification through divergence was extensive among closely related Scaevola species that radiated into novel environments, especially in plant morphology and traits affecting water relations. Homoploid hybrid-origin species were ``intermediate'' compared to their ancestral parent species, and possessed trait combinations relevant for their current habitat. The diversity in functional traits reflected strong influences of both ecology and evolutionary history in native Hawaiian Scaevola species, and trait correspondence with environment was due to the combination of multiple processes within the taxon: trait pre-adaptation and filtering, evolutionary convergence, divergence, and hybridization.},

Leaf hits are separated from others by a reduced response at 1548 nm due to water absorption by leaf cellular contents. By digitizing the full return-pulse waveform (full-width half maximum, 1.5 m) at 7.5 cm intervals, the scanner can identify the type of scattering event, as well as identify and separate multiple scattering events along the pulse path to reconstruct multiple hits at distances of up to 100 m from the scanner. Scanning covers zenith angles of 0-119$^\circ$ and 360 azimuth with pulse centers spaced at 4, 2, and 1 mrad intervals, providing spatial resolutions of 4-40, 2-20, and 1-10 cm respectively at 10 and 100 m distances.

  abstract = {Terrestrial ecosystems strongly determine the exchange of carbon, water and energy between the biosphere and atmosphere. These exchanges are influenced by environmental conditions (e.g., local meteorology, soils), but generally mediated by organisms. Often, mathematical descriptions of these processes are implemented in terrestrial biosphere models. Model implementations of this kind should be evaluated by empirical analyses of relationships between observed patterns of ecosystem functioning, vegetation structure, plant traits, and environmental conditions. However, the question of how to describe the imprint of plants on ecosystem functioning based on observations has not yet been systematically investigated. One approach might be to identify and quantify functional attributes or responsiveness of ecosystems (often very short-term in nature) that contribute to the long-term (i.e., annual but also seasonal or daily) metrics commonly in use. Here we define these patterns as ``ecosystem functional properties'', or EFPs. Such as the ecosystem capacity of carbon assimilation or the maximum light use efficiency of an ecosystem. While EFPs should be directly derivable from flux measurements at the ecosystem level, we posit that these inherently include the influence of specific plant traits and their local heterogeneity. We present different options of upscaling in situ measured plant traits to the ecosystem level (ecosystem vegetation properties \textendash{} EVPs) and provide examples of empirical analyses on plants' imprint on ecosystem functioning by combining in situ measured plant traits and ecosystem flux measurements. Finally, we discuss how recent advances in remote sensing contribute to this framework.},

* We explore leaf reflectance as a tool to monitor leaf age and develop a spectra-based partial least squares regression (PLSR) model to predict age using data from a phenological study of 1099 leaves from 12 lowland Amazonian canopy trees in southern Peru.

* Results demonstrated monotonic decreases in leaf water (LWC) and phosphorus (Pmass) contents and an increase in leaf mass per unit area (LMA) with age across trees; leaf nitrogen (Nmass) and carbon (Cmass) contents showed monotonic but tree-specific age responses. We observed large age-related variation in leaf spectra across trees. A spectra-based model was more accurate in predicting leaf age (R2~=~0.86; percent root mean square error (\%RMSE)~=~33) compared with trait-based models using single (R2~=~0.07\textendash{}0.73; \%RMSE~=~7\textendash{}38) and multiple (R2~=~0.76; \%RMSE~=~28) predictors. Spectra- and trait-based models established a physiochemical basis for the spectral age model. Vegetation indices (VIs) including the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index 2 (EVI2), normalized difference water index (NDWI) and photosynthetic reflectance index (PRI) were all age-dependent.

* This study highlights the importance of leaf age as a mediator of leaf traits, provides evidence of age-related leaf reflectance changes that have important impacts on VIs used to monitor canopy dynamics and productivity and proposes a new approach to predicting and monitoring leaf age with important implications for remote sensing.},

  abstract = {Summary Plant canopies are characterized by extensive gradients in light availability that importantly alter the photosynthetic productivity of leaves in different canopy layers and result in acclimatory changes in leaf structural, chemical and physiological traits. These within-canopy variations are further importantly driven by species functional type and ecological characteristics such as shade tolerance (ecological controls). This chapter explores the within-canopy variations in key functional traits among different plant functional types and in species with different ecological potentials using a simple methodology to separate the importance of different leaf-level traits in foliage photosynthetic acclimation. As a major acclimatory change, foliage photosynthetic capacity per leaf area (A max A) increases with increasing long-term average integrated quantum flux density (Q int) in the canopy. Within-canopy variation in A max A results in a greater whole canopy carbon gain than having A max A constant through the canopy. The increase in A max A with Q int can potentially result from increases in leaf dry mass per unit area (M A), nitrogen content per unit dry mass (N M) and nitrogen allocation to rate-limiting photosynthetic proteins. This analysis indicates that the importance of these three key factors varies among plant functional types. In species with relatively low rates of canopy expansion and leaf turnover such as woody evergreens and woody deciduous species, within-canopy variation in A max A is primarily determined by M A, while in herbaceous species with high rates of canopy growth and leaf turnover, the variation is mainly driven by changes in N M and nitrogen allocation to rate-limiting proteins of photosynthetic machinery. Furthermore, there are large within-canopy modifications in structural traits such as leaf angles and spatial aggregation modulating light harvesting and light avoidance, and in chemical traits such as xanthophyll cycle carotenoid content and isoprene emission contributing to abiotic stress resistance. As the result of light-dependent alterations in these traits, lower canopy leaves have a greater light harvesting efficiency, while upper canopy leaves a greater capacity for excess radiation dissipation and resistance to abiotic stress. Plasticity for foliar modifications varies among woody species of different ecological potentials with shade-intolerant species tending to have a greater photosynthetic plasticity, while shade-tolerant species greater leaf areas and higher canopy light interception. This review emphasizes the overall large within-canopy variation in key foliage functional traits and underscores the important differences among plant functional types and in species with different ecological potentials in their acclimation to within-canopy environment.},

  abstract = {A spatial and mechanistic model is developed for the dynamics of transition oak\textemdash{}northern hardwoods forests in northeastern North America. The purpose of the model is to extrapolate from measurable fine\textemdash{}scale and short\textemdash{}term interactions among individual trees to large\textemdash{}scale and long\textemdash{}term dynamics of forest communities. Field methods, statistical estimators, and model structure were designed simultaneously to ensure that parameters could be estimated from data collected in the field. This paper documents eight aspects of a three\textemdash{}year study to calibrate, test, and analyze the model for the nine dominant and subdominant tree species in transition oak\textemdash{}northern hardwoods forests: 1) Design and structure of the model. The model makes population dynamic forecasts by predicting the fate of every individual tree throughout its life. Species\textemdash{}specific functions predict each tree's dispersal, establishment, growth, mortality, and fecundity. Trees occupy unique spatial positions, and individual performance is affected by the local availability of resources. Competition is mechanistic; resources available to each tree are reduced by neighbors. Although the model was developed to include light, water, and nitrogen, the version described here includes only competition for light (shading and light\textemdash{}dependent performance) because the field data provide little evidence of competition for nitrogen and water over the range of sites examined. 2) Estimates of the model's parameters for each species. The estimates reveal a variety of "strategic trade\textemdash{}offs" among the species. For example, species that grow quickly under high light tend to cast relatively little shade, have low survivorship under low light, and have high dispersal. In contrast, species that grow slowly under high light tend to cast relatively dark shade, and to have high survivorship under low light and low dispersal. These trade\textemdash{}offs define one of two dominant "axes" of strategic variation. 3) Community level predictions of the model. The model predicts succession from early dominance by species such as Quercus rubra and Prunus serotina, to late dominance by Fagus grandifolia and Tsuga canadensis, with Betula alleganiensis present as a gap phase species in old\textemdash{}growth stands. The model also predicts that old\textemdash{}growth communities will have intraspecifically clumped and interspecifically segregated spatial distributions. 4) An error analysis that identifies community level predictions that are robust given the level of sampling uncertainty in the study. This analysis translates the statistical uncertainty associated with each parameter estimate into statistical uncertainty in the model's predictions. The robust predictions include those mentioned in aspect (3) above. 5) Sensitivity of the model to changes in initial conditions and to changes in the three parameters not included in the error analysis. For example, the model predicts that initial abundances continue to affect community composition well into succession ($>$ 300 yr for some species). 6) Tests of the system\textemdash{} and community\textemdash{}level predictions of the model against independent data gleaned from other studies. These tests support the predictions found to be robust in the error analysis, including those predictions mentioned in aspect (3) above. 7) Modeling experiments that determine which aspects of individual performance and inter\textemdash{}neighbor competition are responsible for each of the robust predictions identified in aspect (4) above and tested in aspect (6) above. This analysis reveals a wide variety of causal relationships, with most parameters contributing to at least one community level phenomenon. 8) An explanation of the diversity of individual level causes identified in aspect (7). The two "axes" describing most of the strategic variation among the species (see [2]), provide a simple explanation of community level pattern in terms of individual level processes.},

Use of the Kappa indices has become part of the culture in remote sensing and other fields. This article examines five different Kappa indices, some of which were derived by the first author in 2000. We expose the indices' properties mathematically and illustrate their limitations graphically, with emphasis on Kappa's use of randomness as a baseline, and the often-ignored conversion from an observed sample matrix to the estimated population matrix. This article concludes that these Kappa indices are useless, misleading and/or flawed for the practical applications in remote sensing that we have seen. After more than a decade of working with these indices, we recommend that the profession abandon the use of Kappa indices for purposes of accuracy assessment and map comparison, and instead summarize the cross-tabulation matrix with two much simpler summary parameters: quantity disagreement and allocation disagreement. This article shows how to compute these two parameters using examples taken from peer-reviewed literature.},

  abstract = {The concentration of nitrogen (N) in foliage often limits photosynthesis and can influence a number of important biogeochemical processes. For this reason, methods for estimating foliar \%N over a range of scales are needed to enhance understanding of terrestrial carbon and nitrogen cycles. High spectral resolution aircraft remote sensing has become an increasingly common tool for landscape-scale estimates of canopy \%N because reflectance in some portions of the spectrum has been shown to correlate strongly with field-measured \%N. These patterns have been observed repeatedly over a wide range of biomes, opening new possibilities for planned Earth observation satellites. Nevertheless, the effects of spectral resolution and other sensor characteristics on \%N estimates have not been fully examined, and may have implications for future analyses at landscape, regional and global scales. In this study, we explored the effects of spectral resolution, spatial resolution and sensor fidelity on relationships between forest canopy \%N and reflectance measurements from airborne and satellite platforms. We conducted an exercise whereby PLS, simple and multiple regression calibrations to field-measured canopy \%N for a series of forested sites were iteratively performed using (1) high resolution data from AVIRIS (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer) that were degraded spectrally from 10 nm to 30 nm, 50 nm, 70 nm, and 90 nm bandwidths, and spatially from 18 m to 30 m and 60 m pixels; (2) data representing Landsat and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) spectral bands simulated with data from AVIRIS; and (3) actual data from Landsat and MODIS. We observed virtually no reduction in the strength of relationships between \%N and reflectance when using coarser bandwidths from AVIRIS, but instead saw declines with increasing spatial resolution and loss of sensor fidelity. This suggests that past efforts to examine foliar \%N using broad-band sensors may have been limited as much by the latter two properties as by their coarser spectral bandwidths. We also found that regression models were driven primarily by reflectance over broad portions of the near infrared (NIR) region, with little contribution from the visible or mid infrared regions. These results suggest that much of the variability in canopy \%N is related to broad reflectance properties in the NIR region, indicating promise for broad scale canopy N estimation from a variety of sensors.},

  abstract = {Global change has tremendous impacts on savanna systems around the world. Processes related to climate change or agricultural expansion threaten the ecosystem's state, function and the services it provides. A prominent example is the Brazilian Cerrado that has an extent of around 2 million km2 and features high biodiversity with many endemic species. It is characterized by landscape patterns from open grasslands to dense forests, defining a heterogeneous gradient in vegetation structure throughout the biome. While it is undisputed that the Cerrado provides a multitude of valuable ecosystem services, it is exposed to changes, e.g. through large scale land conversions or climatic changes. Monitoring of the Cerrado is thus urgently needed to assess the state of the system as well as to analyze and further understand ecosystem responses and adaptations to ongoing changes. Therefore we explored the potential of dense Landsat time series to derive phenological information for mapping vegetation gradients in the Cerrado. Frequent data gaps, e.g. due to cloud contamination, impose a serious challenge for such time series analyses. We synthetically filled data gaps based on Radial Basis Function convolution filters to derive continuous pixel-wise temporal profiles capable of representing Land Surface Phenology (LSP). Derived phenological parameters revealed differences in the seasonal cycle between the main Cerrado physiognomies and could thus be used to calibrate a Support Vector Classification model to map their spatial distribution. Our results show that it is possible to map the main spatial patterns of the observed physiognomies based on their phenological differences, whereat inaccuracies occurred especially between similar classes and data-scarce areas. The outcome emphasizes the need for remote sensing based time series analyses at fine scales. Mapping heterogeneous ecosystems such as savannas requires spatial detail, as well as the ability to derive important phenological parameters for monitoring habitats or ecosystem responses to climate change. The open Landsat and Sentinel-2 archives provide the satellite data needed for improved analyses of savanna ecosystems globally.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have shown that accounting for intraspecific trait variation (ITV) may better address major questions in community ecology. However, a general picture of the relative extent of ITV compared to interspecific trait variation in plant communities is still missing. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of the relative extent of ITV within and among plant communities worldwide, using a data set encompassing 629 communities (plots) and 36 functional traits. Overall, ITV accounted for 25\% of the total trait variation within communities and 32\% of the total trait variation among communities on average. The relative extent of ITV tended to be greater for whole-plant (e.g. plant height) vs. organ-level traits and for leaf chemical (e.g. leaf N and P concentration) vs. leaf morphological (e.g. leaf area and thickness) traits. The relative amount of ITV decreased with increasing species richness and spatial extent, but did not vary with plant growth form or climate. These results highlight global patterns in the relative importance of ITV in plant communities, providing practical guidelines for when researchers should include ITV in trait-based community and ecosystem studies.},

  doi = {10.1093/aob/mcl066},
  abstract = {Background and Aims When ecologically important plant traits are correlated they may be said to constitute an ecological `strategy' dimension. Through identifying these dimensions and understanding their inter-relationships we gain insight into why particular trait combinations are favoured over others and into the implications of trait differences among species. Here we investigated relationships among several traits, and thus the strategy dimensions they represented, across 2134 woody species from seven Neotropical forests.
Methods Six traits were studied: specific leaf area (SLA), the average size of leaves, seed and fruit, typical maximum plant height, and wood density (WD). Trait relationships were quantified across species at each individual forest as well as across the dataset as a whole. `Phylogenetic' analyses were used to test for correlations among evolutionary trait-divergences and to ascertain whether interspecific relationships were biased by strong taxonomic patterning in the traits.
Key Results The interspecific and phylogenetic analyses yielded congruent results. Seed and fruit size were expected, and confirmed, to be tightly related. As expected, plant height was correlated with each of seed and fruit size, albeit weakly. Weak support was found for an expected positive relationship between leaf and fruit size. The prediction that SLA and WD would be negatively correlated was not supported. Otherwise the traits were predicted to be largely unrelated, being representatives of putatively independent strategy dimensions. This was indeed the case, although WD was consistently, negatively related to leaf size.
Conclusions The dimensions represented by SLA, seed/fruit size and leaf size were essentially independent and thus conveyed largely independent information about plant strategies. To a lesser extent the same was true for plant height and WD. Our tentative explanation for negative WD\textendash{}leaf size relationships, now also known from other habitats, is that the traits are indirectly linked via plant hydraulics.},

  issn = {1365-2486},
  doi = {10.1111/gcb.13389},
  abstract = {Droughts are expected to become more frequent and more intense under climate change. Plant mortality rates and biomass declines in response to drought depend on stomatal and xylem flow regulation. Plants operate on a continuum of xylem and stomatal regulation strategies from very isohydric (strict regulation) to very anisohydric. Coexisting species may display a variety of isohydricity behaviors. As such, it can be difficult to predict how to model the degree of isohydricity at the ecosystem scale by aggregating studies of individual species. This is nonetheless essential for accurate prediction of ecosystem drought resilience. In this study, we define a metric for the degree of isohydricity at the ecosystem scale in analogy with a recent metric introduced at the species level. Using data from the AMSR-E satellite, this metric is evaluated globally based on diurnal variations in microwave vegetation optical depth (VOD), which is directly related to leaf water potential. Areas with low annual mean radiation are found to be more anisohydric. Except for evergreen broadleaf forests in the tropics, which are very isohydric, and croplands, which are very anisohydric, land cover type is a poor predictor of ecosystem isohydricity, in accordance with previous species-scale observations. It is therefore also a poor basis for parameterizing water stress response in land-surface models. For taller ecosystems, canopy height is correlated with higher isohydricity (so that rainforests are mostly isohydric). Highly anisohydric areas show either high or low underlying water use efficiency. In seasonally dry locations, most ecosystems display a more isohydric response (increased stomatal regulation) during the dry season. In several seasonally dry tropical forests, this trend is reversed, as dry-season leaf-out appears to coincide with a shift toward more anisohydric strategies. The metric developed in this study allows for detailed investigations of spatial and temporal variations in plant water behavior.},

  abstract = {Water limitations decrease stomatal conductance (gs) and, in turn, photosynthetic rate (Anet), resulting in decreased crop productivity. The current techniques for evaluating these physiological responses are limited to leaf-level measures acquired by measuring leaf-level gas exchange. In this regard, proximal sensing techniques can be a useful tool in studying plant biology as they can be used to acquire plant-level measures in a high-throughput manner. However, to confidently utilize the proximal sensing technique for high-throughput physiological monitoring, it is important to assess the relationship between plant physiological parameters and the sensor data. Therefore, in this study, the application of rapid sensing techniques based on thermal imaging and visual-near infrared spectroscopy for assessing water-use efficiency (WUE) in foxtail millet (Setaria italica (L.) P. Beauv) was evaluated. The visible-near infrared spectral reflectance (350\textendash{}2500 nm) and thermal (7.5\textendash{}14 $\mathrm{\mu}$m) data were collected at regular intervals from well-watered and drought-stressed plants in combination with other leaf physiological parameters (transpiration rate-E, Anet, gs, leaf carbon isotopic signature-$\delta$13Cleaf, WUE). Partial least squares regression (PLSR) analysis was used to predict leaf physiological measures based on the spectral data. The PLSR modeling on the hyperspectral data yielded accurate and precise estimates of leaf E, gs, $\delta$13Cleaf, and WUE with coefficient of determination in a range of 0.85\textendash{}0.91. Additionally, significant differences in average leaf temperatures (\textasciitilde{}1 $^\circ$C) measured with a thermal camera were observed between well-watered plants and drought-stressed plants. In summary, the visible-near infrared reflectance data, and thermal images can be used as a potential rapid technique for evaluating plant physiological responses such as WUE.},

  doi = {10.5194/acp-16-9047-2016},
  abstract = {Warmer temperatures and elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations over the last several decades have been credited with increasing vegetation activity and photosynthetic uptake of CO2 from the atmosphere in the high northern latitude ecosystems: the boreal forest and arctic tundra. At the same time, soils in the region have been warming, permafrost is melting, fire frequency and severity are increasing, and some regions of the boreal forest are showing signs of stress due to drought or insect disturbance. The recent trends in net carbon balance of these ecosystems, across heterogeneous disturbance patterns, and the future implications of these changes are unclear. Here, we examine CO2 fluxes from northern boreal and tundra regions from 1985 to 2012, estimated from two atmospheric inversions (RIGC and Jena). Both used measured atmospheric CO2 concentrations and wind fields from interannually variable climate reanalysis. In the arctic zone, the latitude region above 60$^\circ$ N excluding Europe (10$^\circ$ W\textendash{}63$^\circ$ E), neither inversion finds a significant long-term trend in annual CO2 balance. The boreal zone, the latitude region from approximately 50\textendash{}60$^\circ$ N, again excluding Europe, showed a trend of 8\textendash{}11 Tg C yr-2 over the common period of validity from 1986 to 2006, resulting in an annual CO2 sink in 2006 that was 170\textendash{}230 Tg C yr-1 larger than in 1986. This trend appears to continue through 2012 in the Jena inversion as well. In both latitudinal zones, the seasonal amplitude of monthly CO2 fluxes increased due to increased uptake in summer, and in the arctic zone also due to increased fall CO2 release. These findings suggest that the boreal zone has been maintaining and likely increasing CO2 sink strength over this period, despite browning trends in some regions and changes in fire frequency and land use. Meanwhile, the arctic zone shows that increased summer CO2 uptake, consistent with strong greening trends, is offset by increased fall CO2 release, resulting in a net neutral trend in annual fluxes. The inversion fluxes from the arctic and boreal zones covering the permafrost regions showed no indication of a large-scale positive climate\textendash{}carbon feedback caused by warming temperatures on high northern latitude terrestrial CO2 fluxes from 1985 to 2012.},

  abstract = {Context Tree species distribution and abundance are affected by forces operating at multiple scales. Niche and biophysical process models have been commonly used to predict climate change effects at regional scales, however, these models have limited capability to include site-scale population dynamics and landscape-scale disturbance and dispersal. We applied a landscape modeling approach that incorporated three levels of spatial hierarchy (pixel, landtype, and ecological subsection) to model regional-scale shifts in forest composition under climate change. Objective To determine (1) how importance value of individual species will change under the PCM B1 and GFDL A1FI modeling scenarios and (2) how overall forest composition at different spatial scales will change under these climate change scenarios in the short, medium, and long term in the Central Hardwood Forest Region (CHFR). Methods We used LANDIS PRO to predict forest composition changes from 2000 to 2300 accounting for climate change, population dynamics, dispersal, and harvest in the CHFR. We analyzed forest composition shifts under alternative climate scenarios and at multiple spatial scales. Results Shifts in forest composition were greater under the GFDL A1FI than the PCM B1 modeling scenarios and were greatest at the scale of ecological sections followed by forest sub-regions and the whole CHFR. Forest composition shifted toward more southern and xeric species and lesser northern and mesic species. Conclusions We suggest it is essential to include site- and landscape-scale processes in models and to evaluate changes at multiple spatial and temporal scales when evaluating changes in species composition due to climate change and disturbance.},

  abstract = {The impact of misregistration on the detection of changes in land cover has been evaluated using spatially degraded Landsat MSS images, focusing on simulated images of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Single-date images from seven areas were misregistered against themselves, and the statistical properties of the differences were analyzed. In the absence of any actual changes to the land surface, the consequences of misregistration were very marked even for subpixel misregistrations. Pairs of images from different time periods were then misregistered. For four densely covered areas, an error equivalent to greater than 50\% of the actual differences in the NDVI, as measured by the semivariance, was induced by a misregistration of only one pixel. To achieve an error of only 10\%, registration accuracies of 0.2 pixels or less are required. For three more sparsely vegetated areas with semiarid climates, a registration accuracy of between 0.5 and 1.0 pixel was sufficient to achieve an error of 10\% or less. The results indicate that high levels of registration are needed for reliable monitoring of global change},

  abstract = {Under the current scenario of rapid human population increase, achieving efficient and productive agricultural land use while conserving biodiversity is a global challenge. There is an ongoing debate whether land for nature and for production should be segregated (land sparing) or integrated on the same land (land sharing, wildlife-friendly farming). While recent studies argue for agricultural intensification in a land sparing approach, we suggest here that it fails to account for real-world complexity. We argue that agriculture practiced under smallholder farmer-dominated landscapes and not large-scale farming, is currently the backbone of global food security in the developing world. Furthermore, contemporary food usage is inefficient with one third wasted and a further third used inefficiently to feed livestock and that conventional intensification causes often overlooked environmental costs. A major argument for wildlife friendly farming and agroecological intensification is that crucial ecosystem services are provided by ``planned'' and ``associated'' biodiversity, whereas the land sparing concept implies that biodiversity in agroecosystems is functionally negligible. However, loss of biological control can result in dramatic increases of pest densities, pollinator services affect a third of global human food supply, and inappropriate agricultural management can lead to environmental degradation. Hence, the true value of functional biodiversity on the farm is often inadequately acknowledged or understood, while conventional intensification tends to disrupt beneficial functions of biodiversity. In conclusion, linking agricultural intensification with biodiversity conservation and hunger reduction requires well-informed regional and targeted solutions, something which the land sparing vs sharing debate has failed to achieve so far.},

The spectrum runs from quick to slow return on investments of nutrients and dry mass in leaves, and operates largely independently of growth form, plant functional type or biome. Categories along the spectrum would, in general, describe leaf economic variation at the global scale better than plant functional types, because functional types overlap substantially in their leaf traits. Overall, modulation of leaf traits and trait relationships by climate is surprisingly modest, although some striking and significant patterns can be seen. Reliable quantification of the leaf economics spectrum and its interaction with climate will prove valuable for modelling nutrient fluxes and vegetation boundaries under changing land-use and climate.},

  abstract = {Abstract: In a climate change scenario, Mediterranean forest species such as pines may be endangered by rising temperatures and reduced precipitation, thus calling for studies on the transpiration and water balance in pines. In this paper, the response of young plants of Pinus sylvestris L., Pinus pinea L. and Pinus halepensis Mill. to different irrigation treatments has been studied. Significant differences were found in water potential, sap flow, leaf-level gas exchange and spectral variables. P. sylvestris had higher pre-dawn and midday water potentials, sap flow rates and leaf-level gas exchange rates compared to the other two species in well-watered conditions. Vapor pressure gradient correlated with stomatal conductance, net assimilation and transpiration, but the association between stomatal conductance and sap flow was weak. The environmental variables more strongly associated with sap flow were solar radiation and reference evapo-transpiration, especially in the well-watered plants, but those associations were weaker in the stressed plants. All three pine species showed the isohydric, drought-avoiding strategy common in the genus Pinus, maintaining relatively high water potentials in dry conditions. Nevertheless, P. halepensis showed a water-saving strategy, with a stomatal closure behavior under drought. Stomatal regulation was less strict in P. sylvestris, closer to a water-spending pattern, while P. pinea showed an intermediate behavior. Significant differences were recorded among species in spectral reflectance in the visible and infra-red regions. Photochemical Reflectance Index, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and combinations of other ratios permitted the discrimination among the three pine species. These spectral variables showed association with sap flow rate, water potential and leaf-level gas exchange variables. Both cluster analysis and k-means classification discriminated Scots pine and Aleppo pine in two different groups. On the other hand, Stone pine showed differences in spectral behavior depending on the hydric status of the plants. Well-watered Stone pine plants had the same spectral behavior as Scots pine, while the plants subjected to drought stress were closer to Aleppo pine plants in spectral response. These findings may help to quantify the impacts of early and mid-summer water deficit on Mediterranean pines in future climate regimes.},

This study was focused on 12 sites of Acer saccharum M. (sugar maple) in the Algoma Region, Canada, where field measurements, laboratory-simulation experiments, and hyper-spectral compact airborne spectrographic imager (CASI) imagery of 72 channels in the visible and near-infrared region and up to 1-m spatial resolution data were acquired in the 1997, 1998, and 1999 campaigns. A different set of 14 sites of the same species were used in 2000 for validation of methodologies. Infinite reflectance and canopy reflectance models were used to link leaf to canopy levels through radiative transfer simulation. The closed and dense (LAI$>$4) forest canopies of Acer saccharum M. used for this study, and the high spatial resolution reflectance data targeting crowns, allowed the use of optically thick simulation formulae and turbid-medium SAILH and MCRM canopy reflectance models for chlorophyll content estimation by scaling-up and by numerical model inversion approaches through coupling to the PROSPECT leaf radiative transfer model. Study of the merit function in the numerical inversion showed that red edge optical indices used in the minimizing function such as R750/R710 perform better than when all single spectral reflectance channels from hyper-spectral airborne CASI data are used, and in addition, the effect of shadows and LAI variation are minimized},

  doi = {10.1016/j.rse.2014.12.008},
  abstract = {Leaf area index (LAI) and leaf chlorophyll content (Chll) represent key biophysical and biochemical controls on water, energy and carbon exchange processes in the terrestrial biosphere. In combination, LAI and Chll provide critical information on vegetation density, vitality and photosynthetic potentials. However, simultaneous retrieval of LAI and Chll from space observations is extremely challenging. Regularization strategies are required to increase the robustness and accuracy of retrieved properties and enable more reliable separation of soil, leaf and canopy parameters. To address these challenges, the REGularized canopy reFLECtance model (REGFLEC) inversion system was refined to incorporate enhanced techniques for exploiting ancillary LAI and temporal information derived from multiple satellite scenes. In this current analysis, REGFLEC is applied to a time-series of Landsat data.

A novel aspect of the REGFLEC approach is the fact that no site-specific data are required to calibrate the model, which may be run in a largely automated fashion using information extracted entirely from image-based and other widely available datasets. Validation results, based upon in-situ LAI and Chll observations collected over maize and soybean fields in central Nebraska for the period 2001\textendash{}2005, demonstrate Chll retrieval with a relative root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) on the order of 19\% (RMSD = 8.42 $\mu$g cm- 2). While Chll retrievals were clearly influenced by the version of the leaf optical properties model used (PROSPECT), the application of spatio-temporal regularization constraints was shown to be critical for estimating Chll with sufficient accuracy. REGFLEC also reproduced the dynamics of in-situ measured LAI well (r2 = 0.85), but estimates were biased low, particularly over maize (LAI was underestimated by \textasciitilde{} 36 \%). This disparity may be attributed to differences between effective and true LAI caused by significant foliage clumping not being properly accounted for in the canopy reflectance model (SAIL). Additional advances in the retrieval of canopy biophysical and leaf biochemical constituents will require innovative use of existing remote sensing data within physically realistic canopy reflectance models along with the ability to exploit the enhanced spectral and spatial capabilities of upcoming satellite systems.},

Several aspects of ENSO are improved in CCSM4 compared to its predecessor CCSM3, including the lengthened period (3\textendash{}6 yr), the larger range of amplitude and frequency of events, and the longer duration of La Ni{\~n}a compared to El Ni{\~n}o.

The simulated ENSO exhibits characteristics consistent with the delayed/recharge oscillator paradigm, including correspondence between the lengthened period and increased latitudinal width of the anomalous equatorial zonal wind stress. Global seasonal atmospheric teleconnections with accompanying impacts on precipitation and temperature are generally well simulated, although the wintertime deepening of the Aleutian low erroneously persists into spring. The vertical structure of the upper-ocean temperature response to ENSO in the north and south Pacific displays a realistic seasonal evolution, with notable asymmetries between warm and cold events. The model shows evidence of atmospheric circulation precursors over the North Pacific associated with the ``seasonal footprinting mechanism,'' similar to observations. Simulated PDV exhibits a significant spectral peak around 15 yr, with generally realistic spatial pattern and magnitude. However, PDV linkages between the tropics and extratropics are weaker than observed.},

  abstract = {Climate change coupled with an intensifying wildfire regime is becoming an important driver of permafrost loss and ecosystem change in the northern boreal forest. There is a growing need to understand the effects of fire on the spatial distribution of permafrost and its associated ecological consequences. We focus on the effects of fire a decade after disturbance in a rocky upland landscape in the interior Alaskan boreal forest. Our main objectives were to (1) map near-surface permafrost distribution and drainage classes and (2) analyze the controls over landscape-scale patterns of post-fire permafrost degradation. Relationships among remote sensing variables and field-based data on soil properties (temperature, moisture, organic layer thickness) and vegetation (plant community composition) were analyzed using correlation, regression, and ordination analyses. The remote sensing data we considered included spectral indices from optical datasets (Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI)), the principal components of a time series of radar backscatter (Advanced Land Observing Satellite\textemdash{}Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS-PALSAR)), and topographic variables from a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)-derived digital elevation model (DEM). We found strong empirical relationships between the normalized difference infrared index (NDII) and post-fire vegetation, soil moisture, and soil temperature, enabling us to indirectly map permafrost status and drainage class using regression-based models. The thickness of the insulating surface organic layer after fire, a measure of burn severity, was an important control over the extent of permafrost degradation. According to our classifications, 90\% of the area considered to have experienced high severity burn (using the difference normalized burn ratio (dNBR)) lacked permafrost after fire. Permafrost thaw, in turn, likely increased drainage and resulted in drier surface soils. Burn severity also influenced plant community composition, which was tightly linked to soil temperature and moisture. Overall, interactions between burn severity, topography, and vegetation appear to control the distribution of near-surface permafrost and associated drainage conditions after disturbance.},

In the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE), these indices are especially important for mapping spatiotemporal variation in the forage available to migratory elk (Cervus elaphus). Here, we examined how the accuracy of using MODIS-derived NDVI and EVI as proxies for forage biomass and quality differed across elevation-related phenology and land use gradients, determined if polynomial NDVI/EVI, site, and season effects improved these models, and then mapped spatiotemporal variation in the abundance of high quality forage available to elk across the Upper Yellowstone River Basin (UYRB) of the GYE. Models with a polynomial NDVI effect explained 19\%\textendash{}55\% more variation in biomass than the linear NDVI and EVI models. Models with linear season effect explained 14\%\textendash{}20\% more variation in chlorophyll, 37\%\textendash{}69\% more variation in crude protein, and 26\%\textendash{}50\% more variation in in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) than the linear NDVI and EVI models. Linear NDVI models explained more variation in biomass and quality across the UYRB than the linear EVI models. The accuracy of these models was lowest in grasslands with late onset of growth, in irrigated agriculture, and after the peak in biomass. Forage biomass and quality varied across the elevation-related phenology and land use gradients in the UYRB throughout the season. At their seasonal peak, the abundance of high quality forage for elk was 50\% greater in grasslands with late onset of growth and 200\% greater in irrigated agriculture than in all other grasslands, suggesting that these grasslands play an especially important role in the movement and fitness of migratory elk. These results provide novel information on the utility of NDVI and EVI for mapping spatiotemporal patterns of forage biomass and quality.},

  abstract = {Significant land greening in the northern extratropical latitudes (NEL) has been documented through satellite observations during the past three decades. This enhanced vegetation growth has broad implications for surface energy, water and carbon budgets, and ecosystem services across multiple scales. Discernible human impacts on the Earth's climate system have been revealed by using statistical frameworks of detection\textendash{}attribution. These impacts, however, were not previously identified on the NEL greening signal, owing to the lack of long-term observational records, possible bias of satellite data, different algorithms used to calculate vegetation greenness, and the lack of suitable simulations from coupled Earth system models (ESMs). Here we have overcome these challenges to attribute recent changes in NEL vegetation activity. We used two 30-year-long remote-sensing-based leaf area index (LAI) data sets, simulations from 19 coupled ESMs with interactive vegetation, and a formal detection and attribution algorithm. Our findings reveal that the observed greening record is consistent with an assumption of anthropogenic forcings, where greenhouse gases play a dominant role, but is not consistent with simulations that include only natural forcings and internal climate variability. These results provide the first clear evidence of a discernible human fingerprint on physiological vegetation changes other than phenology and range shifts.},

  abstract = {Many laboratory studies investigating chlorophyll fluorescence (F) of plants have provided sufficient evidence of the functional link between dynamic changes in photosynthetic activity and F emissions. Far fewer studies, however, have been devoted to detailed analysis of F emission under steady-state conditions, which may be amenable to measurement by passive spectroradiometers onboard airborne or satellite missions. Here, we provide a random-effects meta-analysis of studies using both passively (sun-induced) and actively (e.g. laser-induced) measured steady-state F for detecting stress reactions in terrestrial vegetation. Specifically, we review behaviour of F in red and far-red wavelengths, and also the red to far-red F ratio, for plants physiologically stressed by water deficit, temperature extremes, and nitrogen insufficiency. Results suggest that water stress is, in general, associated with a decline in red and far-red F signal intensity measured at both leaf and canopy levels, whereas the red to far-red F ratio displays an inconsistent behaviour. Chilling, for which only studies with active measurements at the leaf level are available, significantly increased red and far-red F, whereas heat stress produced a less convincing decrease in both F emissions, notably in canopies measured passively. The clearest indicator of temperature stress was the F ratio, which declined significantly and consistently. The F ratio was also the strongest indicator of nitrogen deficiency, revealing a nearly uniformly increasing pattern driven by predominantly declining far-red F. Although significant knowledge gaps were encountered for certain scales and F measurement techniques, the analyses indicate that future airborne or space-borne acquisitions of both red and far-red F signals would be beneficial for timely detection of plant stress events.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the utility of in situ and satellite-based leaf chlorophyll (Chl) estimates for quantifying leaf photosynthetic capacity and for constraining model simulations of Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) over a corn field in Maryland, U.S.A. The maximum rate of carboxylation (Vmax) represents a key control on leaf photosynthesis within the widely employed C3 and C4 photosynthesis models proposed by Farquhar et al. (1980) and Collatz et al. (1992), respectively. A semi-mechanistic relationship between V max 25 (Vmax normalized to 25 $^\circ$C) and Chl is derived based on interlinkages between V max 25 , Rubisco enzyme kinetics, leaf nitrogen, and Chl reported in the experimental literature. The resulting linear V max 25 - Chl relationship is embedded within the photosynthesis scheme of the Community Land Model (CLM), thereby bypassing the use of fixed plant functional type (PFT) specific V max 25 values. The effect of the updated parameterization on simulated carbon fluxes is tested over a corn field growing season using: (1) a detailed Chl time-series established on the basis of intensive field measurements and (2) Chl estimates derived from Landsat imagery using the REGularized canopy reFLECtance (REGFLEC) tool. Validations against flux tower observations demonstrate benefit of using Chl to parameterize V max 25 to account for variations in nitrogen availability imposed by severe environmental conditions. The use of V max 25 that varied seasonally as a function of satellite-based Chl, rather than a fixed PFT-specific value, significantly improved the agreement with observed tower fluxes with Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) increasing from 0.88 to 0.93 and the root-mean-square-deviation decreasing from 4.77 to 3.48 $\mu$mol m-2 s-1. The results support the use of Chl as a proxy for photosynthetic capacity using generalized relationships between V max 25 and Chl, and advocate the potential of satellite retrieved Chl for constraining simulations of GPP in space and time.},

  abstract = {$\blacksquare$ Abstract\hspace{0.6em}An important aim of plant ecology is to identify leading dimensions of ecological variation among species and to understand the basis for them. Dimensions that can readily be measured would be especially useful, because they might offer a path towards improved worldwide synthesis across the thousands of field experiments and ecophysiological studies that use just a few species each. Four dimensions are reviewed here. The leaf mass per area\textendash{}leaf lifespan (LMA-LL) dimension expresses slow turnover of plant parts (at high LMA and long LL), long nutrient residence times, and slow response to favorable growth conditions. The seed mass\textendash{}seed output (SM-SO) dimension is an important predictor of dispersal to establishment opportunities (seed output) and of establishment success in the face of hazards (seed mass). The LMA-LL and SM-SO dimensions are each underpinned by a single, comprehensible tradeoff, and their consequences are fairly well understood. The leaf size\textendash{}twig size (LS-TS) spectrum has obvious consequences for the texture of canopies, but the costs and benefits of large versus small leaf and twig size are poorly understood. The height dimension has universally been seen as ecologically important and included in ecological strategy schemes. Nevertheless, height includes several tradeoffs and adaptive elements, which ideally should be treated separately. Each of these four dimensions varies at the scales of climate zones and of site types within landscapes. This variation can be interpreted as adaptation to the physical environment. Each dimension also varies widely among coexisting species. Most likely this within-site variation arises because the ecological opportunities for each species depend strongly on which other species are present, in other words, because the set of species at a site is a stable mixture of strategies.},

  abstract = {Multisensory platforms for remote sensing measurements offer the possibility to monitor in real-time the crop health status without affecting the crop and environmental conditions. The concept of the speaking plant approach, and plant response based sensing in general, could be valuable providing a better understanding of the interactions between the microclimate and the physical conditions of the plants. Early detection of plant stress is critical, especially in intensive production systems, in order to minimise both acute and chronic loss of productivity. Non-contact and non-destructive sensing techniques can continuously monitor plants and enable automated sensing and control capabilities. This paper reviews past research and recent advances regarding the sensors and approaches used for crop reflectance measurements and the indices used for crop water and nutrient status detection. The most practical and effective indices are those based on ground reflectance sensors data which are evaluated in terms of their efficiency in detecting plant water status under greenhouse conditions. Some possible applications of this approach are summarised. Although crop reflectance measurements have been widely used under open field conditions, there are several factors that limit the application of reflectance measurements under greenhouse conditions. The most promising type of sensors and indices for early stress detection in greenhouse crops are presented and discussed. Future research should focus on real time data analysis and detection of plant water stress using advanced data analysis techniques and to the development of indices that may not be affected by plant microclimate.},

  abstract = {There is evidence that UV radiation may detrimentally affect the biosynthesis of carotenoids, particularly de-epoxided xanthophylls, while strongly promoting phenylpropanoid, particularly flavonoid biosynthesis in a range of taxa. Here we tested the hypothesis that mesophyll flavonoids might protect chloroplasts from UV-induced photo-oxidative damage, by partially compensating for the UV-induced depression of xanthophyll biosynthesis. To test this hypothesis we grew two members of the Oleaceae family, Ligustrum vulgare L. and Phillyrea latifolia L., under either partial shading or fully exposed to sunlight, in the presence or in the absence of UV radiation. The examined species, which display very similar flavonoid composition, largely differ in their ability to limit the transmission of UV and visible light through the leaf and, hence, in the accumulation of flavonoids in mesophyll cells. We conducted measurements of photosynthesis, chlorophyll a fluorescence kinetics, the concentrations of individual carotenoids and phenylpropanoids at the level of whole-leaf, as well as the content of epidermal flavonoids. We also performed multispectral fluorescence micro-imaging to unveil the intra-cellular distribution of flavonoids in mesophyll cells. UV radiation decreased the concentration of carotenoids, particularly of xanthophylls, while greatly promoting the accumulation of flavonoids in palisade parenchyma cells. These effects were much greater in L. vulgare than in P. latifolia. UV radiation significantly inhibited the de-epoxidation of xanthophyll cycle pigments, while enhancing the concentration of luteolin, and particularly of quercetin glycosides. Flavonoids accumulated in the vacuole and the chloroplasts in palisade cells proximal to the adaxial epidermis. We hypothesize that flavonoids might complement the photo-protective functions of xanthophylls in the chloroplasts of mesophyll cells exposed to the greatest doses of UV radiation. However, UV radiation might result in adaxial mesophyll cells being less effective in dissipating the excess of radiant energy, e.g., by decreasing their capacity of thermal dissipation of excess visible light in the chloroplast.},

Here we review a range of methods available to estimate national-level forest carbon stocks in developing countries. While there are no practical methods to directly measure all forest carbon stocks across a country, both ground-based and remote-sensing measurements of forest attributes can be converted into estimates of national carbon stocks using allometric relationships. Here we synthesize, map and update prominent forest biomass carbon databases to create the first complete set of national-level forest carbon stock estimates. These forest carbon estimates expand on the default values recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Guidelines and provide a range of globally consistent estimates.},

  abstract = {Land surface models and dynamic global vegetation models typically represent vegetation through coarse plant functional type groupings based on leaf form, phenology, and bioclimatic limits. Although these groupings were both feasible and functional for early model generations, in light of the pace at which our knowledge of functional ecology, ecosystem demographics, and vegetation-climate feedbacks has advanced and the ever growing demand for enhanced model performance, these groupings have become antiquated and are identified as a key source of model uncertainty. The newest wave of model development is centered on shifting the vegetation paradigm away from plant functional types (PFTs) and towards flexible trait-based representations. These models seek to improve errors in ecosystem fluxes that result from information loss due to over-aggregation of dissimilar species into the same functional class. We advocate the importance of the inclusion of plant hydraulic trait representation within the new paradigm through a framework of the whole-plant hydraulic strategy. Plant hydraulic strategy is known to play a critical role in the regulation of stomatal conductance and thus transpiration and latent heat flux. It is typical that coexisting plants employ opposing hydraulic strategies, and therefore have disparate patterns of water acquisition and use. Hydraulic traits are deterministic of drought resilience, response to disturbance, and other demographic processes. The addition of plant hydraulic properties in models may not only improve the simulation of carbon and water fluxes but also vegetation population distributions.},

  abstract = {To predict regional-scale winter wheat yield, we developed a crop model and data assimilation framework that assimilated leaf area index (LAI) derived from Landsat TM and MODIS data into the WOFOST crop growth model. We measured LAI during seven phenological phases in two agricultural cities in China's Hebei Province. To reduce cloud contamination, we applied Savitzky\textendash{}Golay (S\textendash{}G) filtering to the MODIS LAI products to obtain a filtered LAI. We then regressed field-measured LAI on Landsat TM vegetation indices to derive multi-temporal TM LAIs. We developed a nonlinear method to adjust LAI by accounting for the scale mismatch between the remotely sensed data and the model's state variables. The TM LAI and scale-adjusted LAI datasets were assimilated into the WOFOST model to allow evaluation of the yield estimation accuracy. We constructed a four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4DVar) cost function to account for the observations and model errors during key phenological stages. We used the shuffled complex evolution\textendash{}University of Arizona algorithm to minimize the 4DVar cost function between the remotely sensed and modeled LAI and to optimize two important WOFOST parameters. Finally, we simulated winter wheat yield in a 1-km grid for cells with at least 50\% of their area occupied by winter wheat using the optimized WOFOST, and aggregated the results at a regional scale. The scale adjustment substantially improved the accuracy of regional wheat yield predictions (R2 = 0.48; RMSE = 151.92 kg ha-1) compared with the unassimilated results (R2 = 0.23; RMSE = 373.6 kg ha-1) and the TM LAI results (R2 = 0.27; RMSE = 191.6 kg ha-1). Thus, the assimilation performance depends strongly on the LAI retrieval accuracy and the scaling correction. Our research provides a scheme to employ remotely sensed data, ground-measured data, and a crop growth model to improve regional crop yield estimates.},

One simulation is a no-ENSO run, in which model daily sea surface temperature (SST) in the tropical Pacific Ocean is relaxed to the observed climatology. The other simulation is a fully coupled run and retains ENSO variability. The PDV considered in this study is the first two empirical orthogonal functions of monthly SST anomalies in the North Pacific: the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO). The PDO in the no-ENSO run can be clearly identified. Without ENSO, the PDO displays relatively higher variance at the decadal time scale and no spectral peak at the interannual time scale. In the ENSO run, the PDO variability increases slightly. ENSO not only enhances the variability of the PDO at the interannual time scale, but also shifts the PDO to longer time scales\textemdash{}both consistent with observations. ENSO modulates the Aleutian low and associated surface wind over the North Pacific. The latter, in turn, helps establish a more persistent PDO in the ENSO run. The results also indicate a PDO modulation of global ENSO impacts and the linearity in the superposition of the ENSO-forced and PDO-related atmospheric anomalies. Compared to observations, the NPGO in both simulations lacks power at the time scale longer than 30 yr. On the decadal time scale, the variability of the NPGO is weaker in the ENSO run than in the no-ENSO run.},

  abstract = {In the past two decades, progress in molecular analyses of the plant immune system has revealed key elements of a complex response network. Current paradigms depict the interaction of pathogen secreted molecules with host target molecules leading to the activation of multiple plant response pathways. Further research will be required to fully understand how these responses are integrated in space and time, and exploit this knowledge in agriculture. In this review, we highlight systems biology as a promising approach to reveal properties of molecular plant pathogen interactions and predict the outcome of such interactions. We first illustrate a few key concepts in plant immunity with a network and systems biology perspective. Next, we present some basic principles of systems biology and show how they allow integrating multi-omics data and predict cell phenotypes. We identify challenges for systems biology of plant-pathogen interactions, including the reconstruction of multiscale mechanistic models and the connection of host and pathogen models. Finally, we outline studies on resistance durability through the robustness of immune system networks, the identification of trade-offs between immunity and growth and in silico plant-pathogen co-evolution as exciting perspectives in the field. We conclude that the development of sophisticated models of plant diseases incorporating plant, pathogen and climate properties represent a major challenge for agriculture in the future.

  abstract = {The RAdiative transfer Model Intercomparison (RAMI) activity focuses on the benchmarking of canopy radiative transfer (RT) models. For the current fourth phase of RAMI, six highly realistic virtual plant environments were constructed on the basis of intensive field data collected from (both deciduous and coniferous) forest stands as well as test sites in Europe and South Africa. Twelve RT modelling groups provided simulations of canopy scale (directional and hemispherically integrated) radiative quantities, as well as a series of binary hemispherical photographs acquired from different locations within the virtual canopies. The simulation results showed much greater variance than those recently analysed for the abstract canopy scenarios of RAMI-IV. Canopy complexity is among the most likely drivers behind operator induced errors that gave rise to the discrepancies. Conformity testing was introduced to separate the simulation results into acceptable and non-acceptable contributions. More specifically, a shared risk approach is used to evaluate the compliance of RT model simulations on the basis of reference data generated with the weighted ensemble averaging technique from ISO-13528. However, using concepts from legal metrology, the uncertainty of this reference solution will be shown to prevent a confident assessment of model performance with respect to the selected tolerance intervals. As an alternative, guarded risk decision rules will be presented to account explicitly for the uncertainty associated with the reference and candidate methods. Both guarded acceptance and guarded rejection approaches are used to make confident statements about the acceptance and/or rejection of RT model simulations with respect to the predefined tolerance intervals.},

Abstract
Global vegetation models predict that boreal forests are particularly sensitive to a biome shift during the 21st century. This shift would manifest itself first at the biome's margins, with evergreen forest expanding into current tundra while being replaced by grasslands or temperate forest at the biome's southern edge. We evaluated changes in forest productivity since 1982 across boreal Alaska by linking satellite estimates of primary productivity and a large tree-ring data set. Trends in both records show consistent growth increases at the boreal\textendash{}tundra ecotones that contrast with drought-induced productivity declines throughout interior Alaska. These patterns support the hypothesized effects of an initiating biome shift. Ultimately, tree dispersal rates, habitat availability and the rate of future climate change, and how it changes disturbance regimes, are expected to determine where the boreal biome will undergo a gradual geographic range shift, and where a more rapid decline.},

  abstract = {Currently, multiple leaf area index (LAI) products retrieved from remote sensing data are widely used in crop growth monitoring, land-surface process simulation and studies of climate change. However, most LAI products are only retrieved from individual satellite observations, which may result in spatial-temporal discontinuities and low accuracy in these products. In this paper, a new method was developed to simultaneously retrieve multiscale LAI data from satellite observations with different spatial resolutions based on an ensemble multiscale filter (EnMsF). The LAI average values corresponding to the date of satellite observations were calculated from the multi-year Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI product and were used as a priori knowledge for LAI in order to construct an initial ensemble multiscale tree (EnMsT). Satellite observations obtained at different spatial resolutions were then applied to update the LAI values at each node of the EnMsT using a two-sweep filtering procedure. Next, the retrieved LAI values at the finest scale were used as a priori knowledge for LAI for the new round of construction and updating of the EnMsT, until the sum of the difference of LAI values at each node of the EnMsT between two adjacent updates is less than a given threshold. The method was tested using Thematic Mapper (TM) or Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) surface reflectance data and MODIS surface reflectance data from five sites that have different vegetation types. The results demonstrate that the retrieved LAI values for each spatial resolution were in good agreement with the aggregated LAI reference map values for the corresponding spatial resolution. The retrieved LAI values at the coarsest scale provided better accuracy with the aggregated LAI reference map values (root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.45) compared with that obtained from the MODIS LAI values (RMSE = 1.30).},

  abstract = {Nitrogen deposition has been shown to have significant impacts on a range of vegetation types resulting in eutrophication and species compositional change. Data from a re-survey of 89 coastal sites in Scotland, UK, c. 34 years after the initial survey were examined to assess the degree of change in species composition that could be accounted for by nitrogen deposition. There was an overall increase in the Ellenberg Indicator Value for nitrogen (EIV-N) of 0.15 between the surveys, with a clear shift to species characteristic of more eutrophic situations. This was most evident for Acid grassland, Fixed dune, Heath, Slack and Tall grass mire communities and despite falls in EIV-N for Improved grass, Strand and Wet grassland. The increase in EIV-N was highly correlated to the cumulative deposition between the surveys, and for sites in south-east Scotland, eutrophication impacts appear severe. Unlike other studies, there appears to have been no decline in species richness associated with nitrogen deposition, though losses of species were observed on sites with the very highest levels of SOx deposition. It appears that dune vegetation (specifically Fixed dune) shows evidence of eutrophication above 4.1~kg~N~ha-1 yr-1, or 5.92~kg~N~ha-1 yr-1 if the lower 95\% confidence interval is used. Coastal vegetation appears highly sensitive to nitrogen deposition, and it is suggested that major changes could have occurred prior to the first survey in 1976.},

This provides a scaling from plant traits to ecological communities while bypassing the complications of population dynamics. Our method treats community development as a sorting process involving species that are ecologically equivalent except with respect to particular functional traits, which leads to a constrained random assembly of species; the relative abundance of each species adheres to a general exponential distribution as a function of its traits. Using data for eight functional traits of 30 herbaceous species and community-aggregated values of these traits in 12 sites along a 42-year chronosequence of secondary succession, we predicted 94\% of the variance in the relative abundances.
A quantitative model based on plant traits can predict with more than 90 percent success the changes in species abundance that follow abandonment of agricultural sites in southern France.

  abstract = {Phosphorus (P) is an important nutrient, whose concentrations are declining in many European forest ecosystems. Here, we selected five old-aged temperate beech (Fagus sylvatica) forests that represented a sequence of decreasing soil P resources. We addressed the following hypotheses: (i) root P concentrations correspond to soil P concentrations, when P availability is suboptimal for tree nutrition, (ii) decreasing soil P concentrations, and increasing host P demand foster increasing ectomycorrhizal fungal (EMF) species richness and lead to a shift in the EMF community structure towards increasing soil exploration. We found that the decrease in P concentrations along the geosequence was less steep in the organic layer than that in the mineral topsoil. P concentrations in roots showed a positive relationship with P concentrations in soil, with a stronger correlation in coarse than in fine roots. This finding indicates that low P availability mainly affected P storage of the host. The root tips were completely colonized with EMF. In the organic layer EMF biomass was higher than that of saprophytic fungi, and correlated with inorganic P (Pi). In the mineral topsoil EMF biomass was about 10-fold lower than in the organic layer and biomass of saprophytes and microbial P, but not that of EMF, was correlated with Pi and phosphatase activities. Based on these results, we propose that beech P nutrition was mainly achieved by EMF in the organic layer. Variation in EMF species richness was unrelated to P in soil and decreased with increasing N in the organic layer. The EMF community structures were taxonomically divergent and filtered by habitat soil chemistry in the mineral layer and Pi in the organic layer between the P-rich forest and the P-poor forest. Changes in the taxonomic structures of the EMF did not result in corresponding changes in soil exploration. In conclusion, our results support a relationship between soil P concentrations and P storage in roots, but do not support mono-causal relationships between soil P and EMF species richness or hyphal soil exploration. Our results suggest that the taxonomic dissimilarities of the EMF along the P gradient were mainly driven by Pi concentrations in the organic layer and by the nutrient resources in the mineral layer.},

  abstract = {The knowledge about individual trees in forest is highly beneficial in forest management. High density small foot- print multi-return airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data can provide a very accurate information about the structural properties of individual trees in forests. Every tree species has a unique set of crown structural characteristics that can be used for tree species classification. In this paper, we use both the internal and external crown structural information of a conifer tree crown, derived from a high density small foot-print multi-return LiDAR data acquisition for species classification. Considering the fact that branches are the major building blocks of a conifer tree crown, we obtain the internal crown structural information using a branch level analysis. The structure of each conifer branch is represented using clusters in the LiDAR point cloud. We propose the joint use of the k-means clustering and geometric shape fitting, on the LiDAR data projected onto a novel 3-dimensional space, to identify branch clusters. After mapping the identified clusters back to the original space, six internal geometric features are estimated using a branch-level analysis. The external crown characteristics are modeled by using six least correlated features based on cone fitting and convex hull. Species classification is performed using a sparse Support Vector Machines (sparse SVM) classifier.},

  abstract = {The relative importance of biotic, abiotic, and stochastic processes in structuring ecological communities continues to be a central focus in community ecology. In order to assess the role of phylogenetic relatedness on the nature of biodiversity we first quantified the degree of phylogenetic niche conservatism of several plant traits linked to plant form and function. Next we quantified the degree of phylogenetic relatedness across two fundamental scaling dimensions: plant size and neighborhood size. The results show that phylogenetic niche conservatism is likely widespread, indicating that closely related species are more functionally similar than distantly related species. Utilizing this information we show that three of five tropical forest dynamics plots (FDPs) exhibit similar scale-dependent patterns of phylogenetic structuring using only a spatial scaling axis. When spatial- and size-scaling axes were analyzed in concert, phylogenetic overdispersion of co-occurring species was most important at small spatial scales and in four of five FDPs for the largest size class. These results suggest that phylogenetic relatedness is increasingly important: (1) at small spatial scales, where phylogenetic overdispersion is more common, and (2) in large size classes, where phylogenetic overdispersion becomes more common throughout ontogeny. Collectively, our results highlight the critical spatial and size scales at which the degree of phylogenetic relatedness between constituent species influences the structuring of tropical forest diversity.},

When a radiative transfer model (RTM) was used to retrieve these biophysical variables from remote-sensing data, the ill-posed problem was unavoidable. In this study, we focused on the use of agronomic prior knowledge (APK), constructing the relationship between LAI and LCC, to restrict and mitigate the ill-posed inversion results. For this purpose, the inversion results obtained using the SAILH+PROSPECT (PROSAIL) canopy reflectance model alone (no agronomic prior knowledge, NAPK) and those linked with APK were compared. The results showed that LAI inversion had high accuracy. The validation results of the root mean square error (RMSE) between measured and estimated LAI were 0.74 and 0.69 for NAPK and APK, respectively. Compared with NAPK, APK improved LCC estimation; the corresponding RMSE values of NAPK and APK were 13.36 $\mathrm{\mu}$g cm\textendash{}2 and 9.35 $\mathrm{\mu}$g cm\textendash{}2, respectively. Our analysis confirms the operational potential of PROSAIL model inversion for the retrieval of biophysical variables by integrating APK.},

This database provides a unique view of the broad patterns of the biogeographical and ecoclimatic diversity of the global land surface, and presents a detailed interpretation of the extent of human development. The project was carried out as an International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme, Data and Information Systems (IGBP-DIS) initiative. The IGBP DISCover global land cover product is an integral component of the global land cover database. DISCover includes 17 general land cover classes defined to meet the needs of IGBP core science projects. A formal accuracy assessment of the DISCover data layer will be completed in 1998. The 1 km global land cover database was developed through a continent-by-continent unsupervised classification of 1 km monthly Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) composites covering 1992-1993. Extensive post-classification stratification was necessary to resolve spectral/temporal confusion between disparate land cover types. The complete global database consists of 961 seasonal land cover regions that capture patterns of land cover, seasonality and relative primary productivity. The seasonal land cover regions were aggregated to produce seven separate land cover data sets used for global environmental modelling and assessment. The data sets include IGBP DISCover, U.S. Geological Survey Anderson System, Simple Biosphere Model, Simple Biosphere Model 2, Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme, Olson Ecosystems and Running Global Remote Sensing Land Cover. The database also includes all digital sources that were used in the classification. The complete database can be sourced from the website: http://edcwww.cr.usgs.gov/landdaac/glcc/glcc.html.},

Traditional dynamic vegetation models use plant functional types that are summarized to such an extent that they become meaningless for biodiversity scenarios. Hybrid dynamic vegetation models of intermediate complexity (hybrid-DVMs) have recently been developed to address this issue. These models, at the crossroads between phenomenological and process-based models, are able to involve an intermediate number of well-chosen plant functional groups (PFGs). The challenge is to build meaningful PFGs that are representative of plant biodiversity, and consistent with the parameters and processes of hybrid-DVMs. Here, we propose and test a framework based on few selected traits to define a limited number of PFGs, which are both representative of the diversity (functional and taxonomic) of the flora in the Ecrins National Park, and adapted to hybrid-DVMs. This new classification scheme, together with recent advances in vegetation modeling, constitutes a step forward for mechanistic biodiversity modeling.},

  doi = {10.1111/gcb.12871},
  abstract = {Earth system models demonstrate large uncertainty in projected changes in terrestrial carbon budgets. The lack of inclusion of adaptive responses of vegetation communities to the environment has been suggested to hamper the ability of modeled vegetation to adequately respond to environmental change. In this study, variation in functional responses of vegetation has been added to an earth system model (ESM) based on ecological principles. The restriction of viable mean trait values of vegetation communities by the environment, called `habitat filtering', is an important ecological assembly rule and allows for determination of global scale trait\textendash{}environment relationships. These relationships were applied to model trait variation for different plant functional types (PFTs). For three leaf traits (specific leaf area, maximum carboxylation rate at 25~$^\circ$C, and maximum electron transport rate at 25~$^\circ$C), relationships with multiple environmental drivers, such as precipitation, temperature, radiation, and CO2, were determined for the PFTs within the Max Planck Institute ESM. With these relationships, spatiotemporal variation in these formerly fixed traits in PFTs was modeled in global change projections (IPCC RCP8.5 scenario). Inclusion of this environment-driven trait variation resulted in a strong reduction of the global carbon sink by at least 33\% (2.1 Pg C yr-1) from the 2nd quarter of the 21st century onward compared to the default model with fixed traits. In addition, the mid- and high latitudes became a stronger carbon sink and the tropics a stronger carbon source, caused by trait-induced differences in productivity and relative respirational costs. These results point toward a reduction of the global carbon sink when including a more realistic representation of functional vegetation responses, implying more carbon will stay airborne, which could fuel further climate change.},

  abstract = {Real-time, nondestructive monitoring of crop nitrogen (N) status is a critical factor for precision N management during wheat production. Over a 3-year period, we analyzed different wheat cultivars grown under different experimental conditions in China and Canada and studied the effects of viewing angle on the relationships between various vegetation indices (VIs) and leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) using hyperspectral data from 11 field experiments. The objective was to improve the prediction accuracy by minimizing the effects of viewing angle on LNC estimation to construct a novel vegetation index (VI) for use under different experimental conditions. We examined the stability of previously reported optimum VIs obtained from 13 traditional indices for estimating LNC at 13 viewing zenith angles (VZAs) in the solar principal plane (SPP). Backscattering direction showed better index performance than forward scattering direction. Red-edge VIs including modified normalized difference vegetation index (mND705), ratio index within the red edge region (RI-1dB) and normalized difference red edge index (NDRE) were highly correlated with LNC, as confirmed by high R2 determination coefficients. However, these common VIs tended to saturation, as the relationships strongly depended on experimental conditions. To overcome the influence of VZA on VIs, the chlorophyll- and LNC-sensitive NDRE index was divided by the floating-position water band index (FWBI) to generate the integrated narrow-band vegetation index. The highest correlation between the novel NDRE/FWBI parameter and LNC (R2 = 0.852) occurred at -10$^\circ$, while the lowest correlation (R2 = 0.745) occurred at 60$^\circ$. NDRE/FWBI was more highly correlated with LNC than existing commonly used VIs at an identical viewing zenith angle. Upon further analysis of angle combinations, our novel VI exhibited the best performance, with the best prediction accuracy at 0$^\circ$ to -20$^\circ$ (R2 = 0.838, RMSE = 0.360) and relatively good accuracy at 0$^\circ$ to -30$^\circ$ (R2 = 0.835, RMSE = 0.366). As it is possible to monitor plant N status over a wide range of angles using portable spectrometers, viewing angles of as much as 0$^\circ$ to -30$^\circ$ are common. Consequently, we developed a united model across angles of 0$^\circ$ to -30$^\circ$ to reduce the effects of viewing angle on LNC prediction in wheat. The proposed combined NDRE/FWBI parameter, designated the wide-angle-adaptability nitrogen index (WANI), is superior for estimating LNC in wheat on a regional scale in China and Canada.},

Physical environment responses to warming have been reported, but not details of large-area temperate growing season impacts, or consequences for ecosystems and agriculture. To date, hemispheric-scale measurements of biospheric changes have been confined to remote sensing. However, these studies did not provide detailed data needed for many investigations. Here, we show that a suite of modeled and derived measures (produced from daily maximum\textendash{}minimum temperatures) linking plant development (phenology) with its basic climatic drivers provide a reliable and spatially extensive method for monitoring general impacts of global warming on the start of the growing season. Results are consistent with prior smaller area studies, confirming a nearly universal quicker onset of early spring warmth (spring indices (SI) first leaf date, -1.2~days~decade-1), late spring warmth (SI first bloom date, -1.0~days~decade-1; last spring day below 5$^\circ$C, -1.4~days~decade-1), and last spring freeze date (-1.5~days~decade-1) across most temperate NH land regions over the 1955\textendash{}2002 period. However, dynamics differ among major continental areas with North American first leaf and last freeze date changes displaying a complex spatial relationship. Europe presents a spatial pattern of change, with western continental areas showing last freeze dates getting earlier faster, some central areas having last freeze and first leaf dates progressing at about the same pace, while in portions of Northern and Eastern Europe first leaf dates are getting earlier faster than last freeze dates. Across East Asia last freeze dates are getting earlier faster than first leaf dates.},

However, considerable uncertainties remain concerning potential feedback between the biota and the climate. In particular, it is unclear how global warming will affect the metabolic balance between the photosynthetic fixation and respiratory release of CO2 at the ecosystem scale. Here, we present a combination of experimental field data from freshwater mesocosms, and theoretical predictions derived from the metabolic theory of ecology to investigate whether warming will alter the capacity of ecosystems to absorb CO2. Our manipulative experiment simulated the temperature increases predicted for the end of the century and revealed that ecosystem respiration increased at a faster rate than primary production, reducing carbon sequestration by 13 per cent. These results confirmed our theoretical predictions based on the differential activation energies of these two processes. Using only the activation energies for whole ecosystem photosynthesis and respiration we provide a theoretical prediction that accurately quantified the precise magnitude of the reduction in carbon sequestration observed experimentally. We suggest the combination of whole-ecosystem manipulative experiments and ecological theory is one of the most promising and fruitful research areas to predict the impacts of climate change on key ecosystem services.},

Recent technological advances for assessing optical properties of plants offer opportunities to detect functional traits of organisms and differentiate levels of biological organization across the tree of life. Here, we connect leaf-level full range spectral data (400\textendash{}2400 nm) of leaves to the hierarchical organization of plant diversity within the oak genus (Quercus) using field and greenhouse experiments in which environmental factors and plant age are controlled. We show that spectral data significantly differentiate populations within a species and that spectral similarity is significantly associated with phylogenetic similarity among species. We further show that hyperspectral information allows more accurate classification of taxa than spectrally-derived traits, which by definition are of lower dimensionality. Finally, model accuracy increases at higher levels in the hierarchical organization of plant diversity, such that we are able to better distinguish clades than species or populations. This pattern supports an evolutionary explanation for the degree of optical differentiation among plants and demonstrates potential for remote detection of genetic and phylogenetic diversity.},

Averaged over the study area, the model simulated increases in primary production and leaf area index, and an increasing representation of shrubs and trees in vegetation. The main underlying mechanism was a warming-driven increase in growing season length, enhancing the production of shrubs and trees to the detriment of shaded ground-level vegetation. The simulated vegetation changes were estimated to correspond to a 1.75 \% decline in snow-season albedo.

  abstract = {Human activities, especially conversion and degradation of habitats, are causing global biodiversity declines. How local ecological assemblages are responding is less clear\textemdash{}a concern given their importance for many ecosystem functions and services. We analysed a terrestrial assemblage database of unprecedented geographic and taxonomic coverage to quantify local biodiversity responses to land use and related changes. Here we show that in the worst-affected habitats, these pressures reduce within-sample species richness by an average of 76.5\%, total abundance by 39.5\% and rarefaction-based richness by 40.3\%. We estimate that, globally, these pressures have already slightly reduced average within-sample richness (by 13.6\%), total abundance (10.7\%) and rarefaction-based richness (8.1\%), with changes showing marked spatial variation. Rapid further losses are predicted under a business-as-usual land-use scenario; within-sample richness is projected to fall by a further 3.4\% globally by 2100, with losses concentrated in biodiverse but economically poor countries. Strong mitigation can deliver much more positive biodiversity changes (up to a 1.9\% average increase) that are less strongly related to countries' socioeconomic status.

  abstract = {Evergreen boreal plant species express high variability in their leaf traits. It remains controversial whether this within-species variability is constrained to the same leaf trait relationships as has been observed across species. We sampled leaves of three boreal evergreen woody species along a latitudinal gradient (from 57\textordmasculine{}56${'}$N to 69\textordmasculine{}55${'}$N). Leaf longevity (LL) of Pinus sylvestris L. and Vaccinium vitis-idaea L. correlated negatively with mean annual air temperature (MAT), whereas the LL of Ledum palustre L. was not affected by MAT. V. vitis-idaea and L. palustre had a negative relationship between leaf mass per area (LMA) and MAT. In P. sylvestris, the LMA\textendash{}MAT relationship was positive. A negative correlation between LL and LMA was significant only for P. sylvestris. Leaf nitrogen concentration was positively related to leaf phosphorus concentration in all three species. Leaf potassium concentration was related to nitrogen concentration only in L. palustre, and to phosphorus concentration in P. sylvestris and L. palustre. Our results demonstrate that although within the studied species the variation in some of the leaf traits may have the same degree as interspecific variation, there is no such intercorrelation of leaf traits within the studied species as has been observed across species.},

It was shown that the adaptation of photosynthetic apparatus of C. bungei to forest conditions does not lie in biochemical and primary photosynthetic processes but consists of quantitative changes in the leaf tissue-cellular structure. Steppe and forest individuals differed neither in photosynthetic capacity nor in kinetic parameters of photosynthesis. It is assumed that the development of Caragana's leaves at high light in the spring larch forest leads to the formation of a strong photosynthetic apparatus as a preadaptation to fluctuating light under the forest canopy. At the same time, forest shrubs had thinner and less dense leaves due to the decreased size and number of mesophyll cells. The decrease in the structural complexity of the mesophyll was compensated for by enhancement of the photosynthetic capacity of cells and chloroplasts. The low rate of real photosynthesis under the forest canopy shadow was observed, but it was compensated by a high relative mass and area of the leaves. As a result there were no differences in shrub sizes between steppe and forest shrubs of Caragana. We concluded that photosynthesis adaptation at the levels of leaf mesophyll and of the ratio of photosynthetic organs allow this species to maintain growth and to gain an advantage in an open larch forest.},

Here we examined leaf anatomy and specific leaf area (SLA) in 13 dominant tree species of dry forests in central Brazil, identifying structural patterns of these species. As the system is seasonal, with species presenting a deciduous behavior, we expect to find tree species with a set of mesomorphic leaf traits. The studied dry forest trees share similar leaf structure, with one-layered adaxial and abaxial epidermis and a well-developed mesophyll, high values of SLA, and the presence of calcium crystals and mucilaginous cells. Higher values of SLA and the high investment achieved in the mesophyll (especially in parenchyma tissue) are probably related to the accomplishment of a high performance of carbon and nutrients gain during the limited wet season.},

Following a 6-yr development and production effort, NCEP's North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) project was completed in 2004, and data are now available to the scientific community. Along with the use of the NCEP Eta model and its Data Assimilation System (at 32-km-45-layer resolution with 3-hourly output), the hallmarks of the NARR are the incorporation of hourly assimilation of precipitation, which leverages leverages a comprehensive precipitation analysis effort, the use of a recent version of the Noah land surface model, and the use of numerous other datasets that are additional or improved compared to the GR. Following the practice applied to NCEP's GR, the 25-yr NARR retrospective production period (1979-2003) is augmented by the construction and daily execution of a system for near-real-time continuation of the NARR, known as the Regional Climate Data Assimilation System (R-CDAS). Highlights of the NARR results are presented: precipitation over the continental United States (CONUS), which is seen to be very near the ingested analyzed precipitation; fits of tropospheric temperatures and winds to rawinsonde observations; and fits of 2-m temperatures and 10-m winds to surface station observations. The aforementioned fits are compared to those of the NCEP-Department of Energy (DOE) Global Reanalysis (GR2). Not only have the expectations cited above been fully met, but very substantial improvements in the accuracy of temperatures and winds compared to that of GR2 are achieved throughout the troposphere. Finally, the numerous datasets produced are outlined and information is provided on the data archiving and present data availability.},

Given the complex nature of the data to be expected from these missions, a thorough preparation for them is essential and this can be accomplished by realistic simulation of the imagery data, years before the actual launch. Based on given spectral and directional capabilities of the instrument, and in combination with biophysical land surface properties obtained from existing imagery, the spectral and directional responses of several types of vegetation and bare soil have been simulated pixel by pixel using the radiative transfer models PROSPECT (for hyperspectral leaf reflectance and transmittance), GeoSAIL (for two-layer canopy bidirectional spectral reflectance), and MODTRAN4 (for atmospheric hyperspectral and directional effects). In this way, one obtains realistically simulated hyperspectral and directional top-of-atmosphere spectral radiance images, with all major effects included, such as heterogeneity of the landscape, non-Lambertian reflectance of the land surface, the atmospheric adjacency effect, and the limited spatial resolution of the instrument. The output of the image simulations can be used to demonstrate the capabilities of future earth observation missions. In addition, instrument specifications and image acquisition strategies might be optimized on the basis of simulated image analysis results, and new advanced data assimilation procedures could be validated with realistic inputs under controlled circumstances. This paper describes the applied methodology, the study area with the input images, the set-up of the actual image simulations, and discusses the final results obtained.},

  abstract = {Insights into how terrestrial ecosystems affect the Earth's response to changes in climate and rising atmospheric CO2 levels rely heavily on the predictions of terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs). These models contain detailed mechanistic representations of biological processes affecting terrestrial ecosystems; however, their ability to simultaneously predict field-based measurements of terrestrial vegetation dynamics and carbon fluxes has remained largely untested. In this study, we address this issue by developing a constrained implementation of a new structured TBM, the Ecosystem Demography model version 2 (ED2), which explicitly tracks the dynamics of fine-scale ecosystem structure and function. Carbon and water flux measurements from an eddy-flux tower are used in conjunction with forest inventory measurements of tree growth and mortality at Harvard Forest (42.5$^\circ$N, 72.1$^\circ$W) to estimate a number of important but weakly constrained model parameters. Evaluation against a decade of tower flux and forest dynamics measurements shows that the constrained ED2 model yields greatly improved predictions of annual net ecosystem productivity, carbon partitioning, and growth and mortality dynamics of both hardwood and conifer trees. The generality of the model formulation is then evaluated by comparing the model's predictions against measurements from two other eddy-flux towers and forest inventories of the northeastern United States and Quebec. Despite the markedly different composition throughout this region, the optimized model realistically predicts observed patterns of carbon fluxes and tree growth. These results demonstrate how TBMs parameterized with field-based measurements can provide quantitative insight into the underlying biological processes governing ecosystem composition, structure, and function at larger scales.},

  abstract = {The relative concentrations of different pigments within a leaf have significant physiological and spectral consequences. Photosynthesis, light use efficiency, mass and energy exchange, and stress response are dependent on relationships among an ensemble of pigments. This ensemble also determines the visible characteristics of a leaf, which can be measured remotely and used to quantify leaf biochemistry and structure. But current remote sensing approaches are limited in their ability to resolve individual pigments. This paper focuses on the incorporation of three pigments\textemdash{}chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and total carotenoids\textemdash{}into the LIBERTY leaf radiative transfer model to better understand relationships between leaf biochemical, biophysical, and spectral properties.

Pinus ponderosa and Pinus jeffreyi needles were collected from three sites in the California Sierra Nevada. Hemispheric single-leaf visible reflectance and transmittance and concentrations of chlorophylls a and b and total carotenoids of fresh needles were measured. These data were input to the enhanced LIBERTY model to estimate optical and biochemical properties of pine needles. The enhanced model successfully estimated reflectance (RMSE = 0.0255, BIAS = 0.00477, RMS\%E = 16.7\%), had variable success estimating transmittance (RMSE = 0.0442, BIAS = 0.0294, RMS\%E = 181\%), and generated very good estimates of carotenoid concentrations (RMSE = 2.48~$\mathrm{\mu}$g/cm2, BIAS = 0.143~$\mathrm{\mu}$g/cm2, RMS\%E = 20.4\%), good estimates of chlorophyll a concentrations (RMSE = 10.7~$\mathrm{\mu}$g/cm2, BIAS = - 0.992~$\mathrm{\mu}$g/cm2, RMS\%E = 21.1\%), and fair estimates of chlorophyll b concentrations (RMSE = 7.49~$\mathrm{\mu}$g/cm2, BIAS = - 2.12~$\mathrm{\mu}$g/cm2, RMS\%E = 43.7\%). Overall root mean squared errors of reflectance, transmittance, and pigment concentration estimates were lower for the three-pigment model than for the single-pigment model. The algorithm to estimate three in vivo specific absorption coefficients is robust, although estimated values are distorted by inconsistencies in model biophysics. The capacity to invert the model from single-leaf reflectance and transmittance was added to the model so it could be coupled with vegetation canopy models to estimate canopy biochemistry from remotely sensed data.},

  abstract = {We examined tree species responses under forest harvesting and an increased fire disturbance scenario due to climate warming in northern Wisconsin where northern hardwood and boreal forests are currently predominant. Individual species response at the ecosystem scale was simulated with a gap model, which integrates soil, climate and species data, stratified by ecoregions. Such responses were quantified as species establishment coefficients. These coefficients were used to parameterize a spatially explicit landscape model, LANDIS. Species response to climate warming at the landscape scale was simulated with LANDIS, which integrates ecosystem dynamics with spatial processes including seed dispersal, fire disturbance, and forest harvesting. Under a 5 $^\circ$C annual temperature increase predicted by global climate models (GCM), our simulation results suggest that significant change in species composition and abundance could occur in the two ecoregions in the study area. In the glacial lake plain (lakeshore) ecoregion under warming conditions, boreal and northern hardwood species such as red oak, sugar maple, white pine, balsam fir, paper birch, yellow birch, and aspen decline gradually during and after climate warming. Southern species such as white ash, hickory, bur oak, black oak, and white oak, which are present in minor amounts before the warming, increase in abundance on the landscape. The transition of the northern hardwood and boreal forest to one dominated by southern species occurs around year 200. In the sand barrens ecoregion under warming conditions, red pine initially benefits from the decline of other northern hardwood species, and its abundance quickly increases. However, red pine and jack pine as well as new southern species are unable to reproduce, and the ecoregion could transform into a region with only grass and shrub species around 250 years under warming climate. Increased fire frequency can accelerate the decline of shade-tolerant species such as balsam fir and sugar maple and accelerate the northward migration of southern species. Forest harvesting accelerated the decline of northern hardwood and boreal tree species. This is especially obvious on the barrens ecoregion, where the intensive cutting regime contributed to the decline of red pine and jack pine already under stressed environments. Forest managers may instead consider a conservative cutting plan or protective management scenarios with limited forest harvesting. This could prolong the transformation of the barrens into prairie from one-half to one tree life cycle.},

  abstract = {Most plant species feature similar biochemical compositions and thus similar spectral signals. Still, empirical evidence suggests that the spectral discrimination of species and plant assemblages is possible. Success depends on the presence or absence of faint but detectable differences in biochemical (e.g., pigments, leaf water and dry matter content) and structural properties (e.g., leaf area, angle, and leaf structure), i.e., optical traits. A systematic analysis of the contributions and spatio-temporal variability of optical traits for the remote sensing of organismic vegetation patterns has not yet been conducted. We thus use time series of optical trait values retrieved from the reflectance signal using physical models (optical trait indicators, OTIs) to answer the following questions: How are optical traits related among patterns of floristic composition and reflectance? How variable are these relations in space and time? Are OTIs suitable predictors of plant species composition?

We conducted a case study of three temperate open study sites with semi-natural vegetation. The canopy reflectance of permanent vegetation plots was measured on multiple dates over the vegetation period using a field spectrometer. We recorded the cover fractions of all plant species found in the vegetation plots and extracted gradients of species composition from these data. The physical PROSAIL leaf and canopy optical properties model was inverted with random forest regression models to retrieve time series of OTIs for each plot from the reflectance spectra. We analyzed these data sets using correlation analyses. This approach allowed us to assess the distribution of optical traits across gradients of species composition. The predictive performance of OTIs was tested in relation to canopy reflectance using random forest models.

OTIs showed pronounced relationships with floristic patterns in all three study sites. These relationships were subject to considerable temporal variability. Such variability was driven by short-term vegetation dynamics introduced by local resource stress. In 72\% of all cases OTIs out-performed the original canopy reflectance spectra as indicators of plant species composition. OTIs are also easier to interpret in an ecological sense than spectral bands or features. We thus conclude that optical traits retrieved from reflectance data have a high indicative value for ecological research and applications.},

Here, we review recent studies that utilize remote sensing to understand the supply and demand of ecosystem services, with a specific focus on pollination services by bees in forested and agroforestry contexts. Pollination by bees is a globally threatened ecosystem service that supports the production of food crops and maintains plant biodiversity. We explore how studies that use remote sensing to characterize landscapes, monitor individual organisms, measure biodiversity proxies or species habitat, and describe ecosystem processes may improve modeling of pollination services on spatial scales that match large-scale management efforts, such as forest conservation policy. We then discuss future research opportunities, such as exploring LiDAR and radar for 3-D habitat measurements, mapping phenology in space and time, and direct measurement of pollination events and outcomes.},

Correction schemes require spatially distributed estimates of vegetation water content at scales comparable to that of the microwave sensor footprint (101 to 104 m). This study compares the relative utility of high-resolution (1.5 m) aircraft and coarser-resolution (30 m) Landsat imagery in upscaling an extensive set of ground-based measurements of canopy biophysical properties collected during the Soil Moisture Experiment of 2002 (SMEX02) within the Walnut Creek Watershed. The upscaling was accomplished using expolinear relationships developed between spectral vegetation indices and measurements of leaf area index, canopy height, and vegetation water content. Of the various indices examined, a Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), derived from near- and shortwave-infrared reflectances, was found to be least susceptible to saturation at high levels of leaf area index. With the aircraft data set, which did not include a short-wave infrared water absorption band, the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI) yielded best correlations with observations and highest saturation levels. At the observation scale (10 m), LAI was retrieved from both NDWI and OSAVI imagery with an accuracy of 0.6, vegetation water content at 0.7 kg m-2, and canopy height to within 0.2 m. Both indices were used to estimate field-scale mean canopy properties and variability for each of the intensive soil-moisture-sampling sites within the watershed study area. Results regarding scale invariance over the SMEX02 study area in transformations from band reflectance and vegetation indices to canopy biophysical properties are also presented.},

However, studies that quantified root biomass in grasslands predominantly focused on areas managed less intensively than the management that is common to most North-West European grassland-based farms. To fill this knowledge gap, we compared, root and stubble biomass, the distribution in the soil and root diameter classes of five common European forage grass species grown under intensive management.MethodsOn a 3 year old trial comparing yield of five cool season forage grass species at two N fertilization levels (190 kg N ha-1 yr-1 or 300 kg N ha-1 yr-1) we sampled root and stubble biomass until a depth of 90 cm deep.ResultsTall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) displayed the highest root and stubble biomass and had the highest mean root diameters of all studied grass species. The total dry biomass below cutting height (stubble + roots up to a depth of 90 cm below the soil surface) varied between 18 and 19 tonnes ha-1 for tall fescue and 10 and 11 tonnes ha-1 for Festulolium at 190 kg N ha-1 yr-1 and 300 kg N ha-1 yr-1, respectively.ConclusionsOur findings emphasize that in intensively managed grassland, root and stubble biomass under a 3 years old sward can be as high as 19 t DM ha-1. Owing to the high forage and root biomass of tall fescue, this species has a high potential in maintaining several ecosystem services.},

We addressed how the shape and magnitude of these relationships vary across temporal, spatial and taxonomic scales to improve estimates of carbon dynamics.

* Photosynthetic CO2 and light response curves, leaf nitrogen (N), chlorophyll (Chl) concentration and specific leaf area (SLA) of 25 grassland species were measured. In addition, C3 and C4 photosynthesis models were parameterized using a novel hierarchical Bayesian approach to quantify the effects of leaf traits on photosynthetic capacity and parameters at different scales.

* The effects of plant physiological traits on photosynthetic capacity and parameters varied among species, plant functional types and taxonomic scales. Relationships in the grassland biome were significantly different from the global average. Within-species variability in photosynthetic parameters through the growing season could be attributed to the seasonal changes of leaf traits, especially leaf N and Chl, but these responses followed qualitatively different relationships from the across-species relationship.

* The results suggest that one broad-scale relationship is not sufficient to characterize ecosystem condition and change at multiple scales. Applying trait relationships without articulating the scales may cause substantial carbon flux estimation errors.},

How these soils will respond to changes in their temperature, moisture, and overlying vegetation is uncertain but critical to understand given the large soil C stocks in these regions. We used a laboratory experiment to examine how temperature and moisture control CO2 and CH4 emissions from mineral soils sampled from the bottom of the annual active layer, i.e., directly above permafrost, in an Alaskan boreal forest. Gas emissions from 30 cores, subjected to two temperatures and either field moisture conditions or experimental drought, were tracked over a 100-day incubation; we also measured a variety of physical and chemical characteristics of the cores. Gravimetric water content was 0.31 $\pm$ 0.12 (unitless) at the beginning of the incubation; cores at field moisture were unchanged at the end, but drought cores had declined to 0.06 $\pm$ 0.04. Daily CO2 fluxes were positively correlated with incubation chamber temperature, core water content, and percent soil nitrogen. They also had a temperature sensitivity (Q10) of 1.3 and 1.9 for the field moisture and drought treatments, respectively. Daily CH4 emissions were most strongly correlated with percent nitrogen, but neither temperature nor water content was a significant first-order predictor of CH4 fluxes. The cumulative production of C from CO2 was over 6 orders of magnitude higher than that from CH4; cumulative CO2 was correlated with incubation temperature and moisture treatment, with drought cores producing 52\textendash{}73 \% lower C. Cumulative CH4 production was unaffected by any treatment. These results suggest that deep active-layer soils may be sensitive to changes in soil moisture under aerobic conditions, a critical factor as discontinuous permafrost thaws in interior Alaska. Deep but unfrozen high-latitude soils have been shown to be strongly affected by long-term experimental warming, and these results provide insight into their future dynamics and feedback potential with future climate change.},

  abstract = {Questions:  Trait differentiation among species occurs at different spatial scales within a region. How does the partitioning of functional diversity help to identify different community assembly mechanisms? Location:  Northeastern Spain. Methods:  Functional diversity can be partitioned into within-community ($\alpha$) and among-communities ($\beta$) components, in analogy to Whittaker's classical $\alpha$ and $\beta$ species diversity concept. In light of ecological null models, we test and discuss two algorithms as a framework to measure $\alpha$ and $\beta$ functional diversity (the Rao quadratic entropy index and the variance of trait values). Species and trait (specific leaf area) data from pastures under different climatic conditions in NE Spain are used as a case study. Results:  The proposed indices show different mathematical properties but similarly account for the spatial components of functional diversity. For all vegetation types along the climatic gradient, the observed $\alpha$ functional diversity was lower than expected at random, an observation consistent with the hypothesis of trait convergence resulting from habitat filtering. On the other hand, our data exhibited a remarkably higher functional diversity within communities compared to among communities ($\alpha\gg\beta$). In contrast to the high species turnover, there was a limited functional diversity turnover among communities, and a large part of the trait divergence occurred among coexisting species. Conclusions:  Partitioning functional diversity within and among communities revealed that both trait convergence and divergence occur in the formation of assemblages from the local species pool. A considerable trait convergence exists at the regional scale in spite of changes in species composition, suggesting the existence of ecological redundancy among communities.},

Yet, interrelationships between water availability and plant use on short timescales are difficult to quantify and remain poorly understood.

* To overcome previous methodological limitations, we coupled high-resolution in~situ observations of stable isotopes in soil and transpiration water. We applied the approach along with Bayesian mixing modeling to track the fate of 2H-labeled rain pulses following drought through soil and plants of deciduous tree ecosystems.

* We resolve how rainwater infiltrates the root zones in a nonequilibrium process and show that tree species differ in their ability to quickly acquire the newly available source. Sessile oak (Quercus petraea) adjusted root uptake to vertical water availability patterns under drought, but readjustment toward the rewetted topsoil was delayed. By contrast, European beech (Fagus sylvatica) readily utilized water from all soil depths independent of water depletion, enabling faster uptake of rainwater.

* Our results demonstrate that species-specific plasticity and responses to water supply fluctuations on short timescales can now be identified and must be considered to predict vegetation functional dynamics and water cycling under current and future climatic conditions.},

  abstract = {Human and natural forces are rapidly modifying the global distribution and structure of terrestrial ecosystems on which all of life depends, altering the global carbon cycle, affecting our climate now and for the foreseeable future, causing steep reductions in species diversity, and endangering Earth's sustainability.

To understand changes and trends in terrestrial ecosystems and their functioning as carbon sources and sinks, and to characterize the impact of their changes on climate, habitat and biodiversity, new space assets are urgently needed to produce high spatial resolution global maps of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of vegetation, its biomass above ground, the carbon stored within and the implications for atmospheric green house gas concentrations and climate. These needs were articulated in a 2007 National Research Council (NRC) report (NRC, 2007) recommending a new satellite mission, DESDynI, carrying an L-band Polarized Synthetic Aperture Radar (Pol-SAR) and a multi-beam lidar (Light RAnging And Detection) operating at 1064 nm. The objectives of this paper are to articulate the importance of these new, multi-year, 3D vegetation structure and biomass measurements, to briefly review the feasibility of radar and lidar remote sensing technology to meet these requirements, to define the data products and measurement requirements, and to consider implications of mission durations. The paper addresses these objectives by synthesizing research results and other input from a broad community of terrestrial ecology, carbon cycle, and remote sensing scientists and working groups. We conclude that:(1)
Current global biomass and 3-D vegetation structure information is unsuitable for both science and management and policy. The only existing global datasets of biomass are approximations based on combining land cover type and representative carbon values, instead of measurements of actual biomass. Current measurement attempts based on radar and multispectral data have low explanatory power outside low biomass areas. There is no current capability for repeatable disturbance and regrowth estimates.
(2)
The science and policy needs for information on vegetation 3D structure can be successfully addressed by a mission capable of producing (i) a first global inventory of forest biomass with a spatial resolution 1 km or finer and unprecedented accuracy (ii) annual global disturbance maps at a spatial resolution of 1 ha with subsequent biomass accumulation rates at resolutions of 1 km or finer, and (iii) transects of vertical and horizontal forest structure with 30 m along-transect measurements globally at 25 m spatial resolution, essential for habitat characterization.

We also show from the literature that lidar profile samples together with wall-to-wall L-band quad-pol-SAR imagery and ecosystem dynamics models can work together to satisfy these vegetation 3D structure and biomass measurement requirements. Finally we argue that the technology readiness levels of combined pol-SAR and lidar instruments are adequate for space flight. Remaining to be worked out, are the particulars of a lidar/pol-SAR mission design that is feasible and at a minimum satisfies the information and measurement requirement articulated herein.},

The N2-fixing species are then fitted into `functional groups' according to their behaviour towards illumination, in order to evaluate their importance in the global dynamics of the stand. The results showed that 67\% of the observed species were nodulated (50, 71 and 77\% of the Caesalpiniaceae, Mimosaceae and Papilionaceae, respectively). In the Caesalpiniaceae, nodule-like structures were reported in the genus Crudia and in the species Senna quinquangulata, although this needs to be confirmed. All the nodules studied in this subfamily were astragaloid and mucunoid. In the Mimosaceae, the ability of a new genus (Balizia) to form nodules was reported, as well as nodulation on aerial roots in Inga stipularis. The nodules studied were mainly mucunoid. In the Papilionaceae, nodulation on aerial roots in Poecilanthe hostmannii and on conventional roots of the genus Paramachaerium were reported for the first time. All types of nodular structures were found in this subfamily but the structures were quite uniform at the tribal level. These are consistent with suggestions that nodule morphology has a taxonomic value. Eight functional groups of N2-fixing species are proposed, ranging from light dependance to shade tolerance. These results indicate the important role played by N2-fixing species in the global dynamics of the stand and that N inputs by N2 fixation were continuous along the gradient of energetic resources that characterizes the silvigenetic process. The interactions between the photosynthetic capacities of the species and the ability to fix N2 in low light conditions are discussed.},

  abstract = {Declining forest health can affect crucial ecosystem functions, such as carbon storage in biomass and soils, the regulation of water regimes, the modulation of regional climate and conservation of biodiversity. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) and imaging spectroscopy (IS) are two potentially complementary remote sensing technologies capable of characterizing and monitoring regional forest health. However, the combined use of ALS and IS data to classify the health of individual trees has not yet been assessed. In this study we propose a new approach utilizing ALS and IS combined to characterize the health of individual trees. Firstly, we applied a recently developed bottom-up individual tree delineation algorithm across a structurally complex floodplain eucalypt forest that has experienced episodes of severe dieback over the past six decades. We further calculated ALS and IS indices for delineated tree crowns and used them as predictor variables in machine learning models. We trained and evaluated an object-oriented random forest classifier against field-measured tree crown dieback and transparency ratios, as indicators of eucalypt tree health and crown density, respectively. Our results showed that dieback levels of individual trees can be classified using ALS and IS with an overall accuracy of 81\% and a kappa score of 0.66, while the classification of tree crown transparency levels had an overall accuracy of 70\% and a kappa score of 0.5. Returned pulse width, intensity and density related ALS indices were the most important predictors in the tree health classification, as they accounted for \&gt; 40\% of the variance in the data. At the forest level in terms of dieback, 81.5\% of correctly delineated trees were classified as healthy, 12.3\% as declining and 6.2\% as dying or dead. Dieback occurred primarily in areas that were flooded \&lt; 5\% of the time, as quantified by Landsat derived flooding frequency (1986\textendash{}2011). Our results provide a novel application of ALS and IS to accurately classify the health of individual trees in a structurally complex eucalypt forest, enabling us to prioritize areas for forest health promotion and conservation of biodiversity.},

  abstract = {We present a case study in which we assessed the effects of a severe soil perturbation on the plant community and soil variables in young hybrid poplar (Populus sp.) plantations of southern Qu{\'e}bec (Canada). Our overall goal was to test if soil perturbation and planting fast-growing species could promote the reestablishment of a relatively diverse plant community. A chronosequence that included three plantations (4, 8, and 12-year old) established after soil scarification, paired with three natural stands representative of the local temperate mixedwood forest comprising both pioneer and late-successional tree species, was implemented. Vegetation surveys and soil collection were performed in 2012 and species traits were provided by the Traits Of Plants In Canada and TRY databases. Principal response curve analyses showed species and functional trait divergence between treated and natural stands at ages 4 and 8, but that those divergences were less at age 12. Species and trait convergences were slower in the scarification furrows than in the scarification berms (mounds between furrows). However, severe site preparation did not appear to affect soil variables on the study sites. Our results suggest that even following severe site preparation, gradual recovery of species and trait composition similar to that of natural stands appears possible in the long term, mainly through fast canopy development by hybrid poplar. However, organic material export and soil erosion risks associated with this type of site preparation need to be evaluated.EDITED BY Sheila Ward},

However, the regional mapping of forest species diversity is still difficult because of the complexity of species distribution and overlapping tree crowns. A new method called ``spectranomics'' that maps forest species richness based on leaf chemical and spectroscopic traits using imaging spectroscopy was developed by Asner and Martin. In this paper, we use this method to detect the relationships among the spectral, biochemical and taxonomic diversity of tree species, based on 20 dominant canopy species collected in a subtropical forest study site in China. Eight biochemical components (chlorophyll, carotenoid, specific leaf area, equivalent water thickness, nitrogen, phosphorus, cellulose and lignin) are quantified by spectral signatures (R2 = 0.57\textendash{}0.85, p \&lt; 0.01). We also find that the simulated maximum species number based on the eight optimal biochemical components is approximately 15, which is suitable for most 30 m \texttimes{} 30 m forest sites within this study area. This research may support future work on regional species diversity mapping using airborne imaging spectroscopy.},

We systematically evaluated various   regularization options to improve leaf   chlorophyll content (LCC) and leaf area index   (LAI) retrievals over agricultural lands,   including the role of (1) cost functions (CFs);   (2) added noise; and (3) multiple solutions   in LUT-based inversion. Three families of CFs   were compared: information measures,   M-estimates and minimum contrast methods. We have only selected CFs without   additional parameters to be tuned, and thus   they can be immediately implemented in   processing chains. The coupled leaf/canopy model   PROSAIL was inverted against simulated   Sentinel-2 imagery at 20 m spatial resolution   (8 bands) and validated against field   data from the ESA-led SPARC (Barrax, Spain)   campaign. For all 18 considered CFs   with noise introduction and opting for the mean   of multiple best solutions considerably   improved retrievals; relative errors can be   twice reduced as opposed to those without these   regularization options. M-estimates were found most successful, but also data normalization   influences the accuracy of the retrievals. Here,   best LCC retrievals were obtained using   a normalized ``L1 -estimate'' function with   a relative error of 17.6\% (r2 : 0.73), while best   LAI retrievals were obtained through non-normalized   ``least-squares estimator'' (LSE) with a relative error of 15.3\% (r2 : 0.74).},

  abstract = {Soil microbial community (SMC) structure affects several ecosystem services (soil-carbon mineralization and stabilization), yet responds to edaphic conditions. Stemflow, water that drains over the exterior surface of trees, concentrates precipitation to soils near the trunk, thereby altering edaphic conditions. While recognizing that a suite of factors can affect soils, our research investigates the potential linkages between soil moisture, chemistry, and SMC structure within near-trunk soils from two species of contrasting stemflow production (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh. [American beech, AB] and Liriodendron tulipifera L. [yellow poplar, YP]) across seasons. Variations in SMC structure were determined by Nonmetric MultiDimensional Scaling (NMDS) analysis of Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) banding patterns. Sequencing/BLAST analysis of dominant DGGE-bands were conducted for shared and unique bands occurring in both AB and YP stemflow-influenced soils. Findings suggest species-specific differences in stemflow potentially alter moisture dynamics, pH, mineral nutrients, and soil-C near-trunk soils. SMC structure also increases in variability under low stemflow flux (i.e., for YP). However, SMC structural variability decreases for near-stem soils across individual trees and seasons when stemflow flux is consistently high (i.e., for AB). Differences in canopy structure that govern stemflow production may be a plant trait capable of altering SMC structure. Variation in SMC structure may be related to tree species stemflow input fluctuation response to seasonal change. Future investigations should consider intricate interrelationships among stemflow and species composition of the SMC in near-trunk soils in order to better contextualize the effect of stemflow on SMC vis-{\`a}-vis other factors, such as litter quality.},

  doi = {10.5589/m08-036},
  abstract = {Accurately predicting forest dynamics and associated carbon fluxes requires both knowledge of the current state of the ecosystem and an understanding of the underlying processes and environmental conditions that influence the ecosystem processes. Here, we apply a combination of light detection and ranging (lidar) remote sensing (LVIS), an individual-based height-structured ecosystem model (ED), and detailed topographic and climate data to address these requirements to predict carbon dynamics at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF) in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Lidar data provided substantial constraints on model estimates of carbon stocks and annual net ecosystem production (ANEP). Lidar-initialized model estimates of carbon stocks (10.77 kg C m-2) were within 5\% of the field estimates over the domain and accounted for the 44\% decrease in carbon stocks observed between minimum and maximum elevation at HBEF. Lidar-initialized model estimates of ANEP (0.023 kg C m-2 year-1) also compared favorably with recent field estimates. Model estimates of ANEP strongly depended on fine-scale (1 ha) lidar data on vegetation structure, environmental gradients, and the dynamics of disturbance events. Substituting fine-scale (1 ha) data on vegetation structure and climate with domain-wide inputs increased model estimates of ANEP by 84\%. Substituting fine-scale climate data with domain-wide inputs but initializing with fine-scale data on vegetation structure increased estimates of ANEP by 40\%. Model simulations initialized with spatial heterogeneity in environmental conditions but that lacked corresponding spatial heterogeneity in vegetation structure were the most problematic because this configuration had serious inconsistencies in areas where the domain mean canopy height exceeded the local potential for vegetation (e.g., at high elevations). Lastly, failing to account for increased natural disturbance rates with elevation increased model estimates of ANEP by 43\%. This research demonstrates that the combination of lidar data and a height-structured ecosystem model can be a powerful tool for estimating forest carbon stocks and fluxes, even in complex mountainous environments. To be most useful for constraining model predictions, lidar data need to be at the scale of the underlying environmental heterogeneity that determines plant vital rates.},

  abstract = {Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) is a joint initiative of the European Commission (EC) and the European Space Agency (ESA), designed to establish a European capacity for the provision and use of operational monitoring information for environment and security applications. ESA's role in GMES is to provide the definition and the development of the space- and ground-related system elements. GMES Sentinel-2 mission provides continuity to services relying on multi-spectral high-resolution optical observations over global terrestrial surfaces. The key mission objectives for Sentinel-2 are: (1) To provide systematic global acquisitions of high-resolution multi-spectral imagery with a high revisit frequency, (2) to provide enhanced continuity of multi-spectral imagery provided by the SPOT (Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre) series of satellites, and (3) to provide observations for the next generation of operational products such as land-cover maps, land change detection maps, and geophysical variables. Consequently, Sentinel-2 will directly contribute to the Land Monitoring, Emergency Response, and Security services. The corresponding user requirements have driven the design toward a dependable multi-spectral Earth-observation system featuring the Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) with 13 spectral bands spanning from the visible and the near infrared to the short wave infrared. The spatial resolution varies from 10 m to 60 m depending on the spectral band with a 290 km field of view. This unique combination of high spatial resolution, wide field of view and spectral coverage will represent a major step forward compared to current multi-spectral missions. The mission foresees a series of satellites, each having a 7.25-year lifetime over a 15-year period starting with the launch of Sentinel-2A foreseen in 2013. During full operations two identical satellites will be maintained in the same orbit with a phase delay of 180$^\circ$ providing a revisit time of five days at the equator. This paper provides an overview of the GMES Sentinel-2 mission including a technical system concept overview, image quality, Level 1 data processing and operational applications.},

This framework distinguishes between the scene, which is real and exists on the ground, and the image, which is a collection of spatially arranged measurements drawn from the scene. The scene model generalizes and parameterizes the essential qualities of the scene. Scene models may be discrete, in which the scene model consists of discrete elements with boundaries, or continuous, in which matter and energy flows are taken to be continuous and there are no clear or sharp boundaries in the scene. In the discrete case, there are two possibilities for models: H- and L-resolution. In the H-resolution case, the resolution cells of the image are smaller than the elements, and thus the elements may be individually resolved. In the L-resolution case, the resolution cells are larger than the elements and cannot be resolved. Most canopy models are L-resolution, deterministic, and noninvertible in nature; image processing models, however, tend to be H-resolution, empirical, and invertible. This taxonomy helps add insight to the development of remote sensing theory and point the way to new, productive areas of research.},

Here, we test if for the quantification of leaf traits an ensemble of regression models, consisting of Partial Least Squares (PLSR), Random Forest (RFR), and Support Vector Machine regression (SVMR) models, is able to improve the robustness of the spectral band selection process compared to the outcome of a single technique alone. The ensemble approach was tested using one artificial and five measured data sets of leaf level spectra and corresponding information on leaf chlorophyll, dry matter, and water content. PLSR models optimized for the goodness of fit, an established approach for band selection, were used to evaluate the performance of the ensemble. Although the fits of the models within the ensemble were poorer than the fits achieved with the reference approach, the ensemble was able to provide a band selection with higher consistency across all data sets. Due to the selection characteristics of the methods within the ensemble, the ensemble selection is moderately narrow and restrictive but in good agreement with known absorption features published in literature. We conclude that analyzing the range of agreement of different model types is an efficient way to select a robust set of spectral bands related to the foliar properties under investigation. This may help to deepen our understanding of the spectral response of biochemical and biophysical traits in foliage and canopies.},

Links between plant traits and the environment, i.e. sets of plant attributes consistently associated with certain environmental conditions, are the consequence of the filtering effect of climatic, disturbance and biotic conditions. These filters determine which components of a species pool are assembled into local communities. We aimed at testing for consistent association between plant traits and climatic conditions along a steep regional gradient, divided into 13 climatically homogeneous sectors, in central-western Argentina. We analyzed 19 vegetative and regeneration traits of the 100 most abundant species along the gradient. For each trait, we tested for homogeneity of frequencies of different categories between sectors and the regional species pool, using the $\chi$2 statistic. We rejected H0 in 71\% of the pair-wise comparisons, which strongly suggests a `filtering effect' of climatic factors on key plant functions. Vegetative traits were filtered more often than regeneration traits. Specific leaf area, life span, ramification, canopy height, leaf weight ratio, carbon investment into support tissue and pollination mode were the traits showing differences in the largest number of pair-wise comparisons. This is probably the first attempt to detect, on a quantitative, statistically conservative basis, consistent linkages between climatic factors and numerous plant traits, over a broad spectrum of environmental conditions and plant growth forms. We discuss the advantages and limitations of this approach in predicting vegetation structure and functioning under present environmental conditions, and those expected for the next century as a consequence of global change.},

The models were forced by historical emissions and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A2 anthropogenic emissions of CO2 for the 1850\textendash{}2100 time period. For each model, two simulations were performed in order to isolate the impact of climate change on the land and ocean carbon cycle, and therefore the climate feedback on the atmospheric CO2 concentration growth rate. There was unanimous agreement among the models that future climate change will reduce the efficiency of the earth system to absorb the anthropogenic carbon perturbation. A larger fraction of anthropogenic CO2 will stay airborne if climate change is accounted for. By the end of the twenty-first century, this additional CO2 varied between 20 and 200 ppm for the two extreme models, the majority of the models lying between 50 and 100 ppm. The higher CO2 levels led to an additional climate warming ranging between 0.1$^\circ$ and 1.5$^\circ$C. All models simulated a negative sensitivity for both the land and the ocean carbon cycle to future climate. However, there was still a large uncertainty on the magnitude of these sensitivities. Eight models attributed most of the changes to the land, while three attributed it to the ocean. Also, a majority of the models located the reduction of land carbon uptake in the Tropics. However, the attribution of the land sensitivity to changes in net primary productivity versus changes in respiration is still subject to debate; no consensus emerged among the models.},

Field-based calculations of potential thaw settlement following the loss of remaining ice-rich permafrost averaged 0.6\,m. This subsidence would cause the surface elevations of forests to drop on average 0.1\,m below the surface water level of adjacent collapse-scar features. Up to 0.5\,m of thaw settlement was documented after recent fires, causing water impoundment and further thawing along forest margins. Substantial heterogeneity in soil properties (organic layer thickness, texture, moisture, and ice content) was attributed to differing site histories, which resulted in distinct soil thermal regimes by soil type. Model simulations showed increasing vulnerability of permafrost to deep thawing and thaw settlement with increased fire severity (i.e., reduced organic layer thickness). However, the thresholds of fire severity that triggered permafrost destabilization varied temporally in response to climate. Simulated permafrost dynamics underscore the importance of multiyear to multidecadal fluctuations in air temperature and snow depth in mediating the effects of fire on permafrost. Our results suggest that permafrost is becoming increasingly vulnerable to substantial thaw and collapse after moderate to high-severity fire, and the ability of permafrost to recover is diminishing as the climate continues to warm.},

  abstract = {Ecosystem service-based management requires an accurate understanding of how human modification influences ecosystem processes and these relationships are most accurate when based on functional traits. Although trait variation is typically sampled at local scales, remote sensing methods can facilitate scaling up trait variation to regional scales needed for ecosystem service management. We review concepts and methods for scaling up plant and animal functional traits from local to regional spatial scales with the goal of assessing impacts of human modification on ecosystem processes and services. We focus our objectives on considerations and approaches for (1) conducting local plot-level sampling of trait variation and (2) scaling up trait variation to regional spatial scales using remotely sensed data. We show that sampling methods for scaling up traits need to account for the modification of trait variation due to land cover change and species introductions. Sampling intraspecific variation, stratification by land cover type or landscape context, or inference of traits from published sources may be necessary depending on the traits of interest. Passive and active remote sensing are useful for mapping plant phenological, chemical, and structural traits. Combining these methods can significantly improve their capacity for mapping plant trait variation. These methods can also be used to map landscape and vegetation structure in order to infer animal trait variation. Due to high context dependency, relationships between trait variation and remotely sensed data are not directly transferable across regions. We end our review with a brief synthesis of issues to consider and outlook for the development of these approaches. Research that relates typical functional trait metrics, such as the community-weighted mean, with remote sensing data and that relates variation in traits that cannot be remotely sensed to other proxies is needed. Our review narrows the gap between functional trait and remote sensing methods for ecosystem service management.},

  abstract = {1. Functional traits are increasingly used to investigate community structure, ecosystem functioning or to classify species into functional groups. These functional traits are expected to be variable between and within species. Intraspecific functional variability is supposed to influence and modulate species responses to environmental changes and their effects on their environment. However, this hypothesis remains poorly tested and species are mostly described by mean trait values without any consideration of variability in individual trait values. 2. In this study, we quantify the extent of intraspecific plant functional trait variability, its spatial structure and its response to environmental factors. Using a sampling design structured along two direct and orthogonal climatic gradients in an alpine valley, we quantified and analysed the intraspecific variability for three functional traits (height, leaf dry matter content and leaf nitrogen content) measured on sixteen plant species with contrasting life histories. 3. Results showed a large variability of traits within species with large discrepancies between functional traits and species. This variability did not appear to be structured within populations. Between populations, the overall variability was partly explained by the selected gradients. Despite the strong effects of temperature and radiation on trait intraspecific variability, the response curves of traits along gradients were partly idiosyncratic. 4.Synthesis. Giving a comprehensive quantification of intraspecific functional variability through the analysis of an original data set, we report new evidence that using a single trait value to describe a given species can hide large functional variation for this species along environmental gradients. These findings suggest that intraspecific functional variability should be a concern for ecologists and its recognition opens new opportunities to better understand and predict ecological patterns in a changing environment. Further analyses are, however, required to compare inter- and intraspecific variability.},

Until recently a suitable and simple technique for the spatial characterisation of surfaces was not readily available. Now, thanks to the development of regionalized variable theory there is a near-ideal tool, the semivariogram. The semivariogram is a function that relates semivariance to sampling lag. This function can be estimated using remotely sensed data or ground data and represented as a plot that gives a picture of the spatial dependence of each point on its neighbor.

  shorttitle = {Leaf Life Span Spectrum of Tropical Woody Seedlings},
  doi = {10.1093/aob/mct036},
  abstract = {Background and Aims Leaf life span is widely recognized as a key life history trait associated with herbivory resistance, but rigorous comparative data are rare for seedlings. The goal of this study was to examine how light environment affects leaf life span, and how ontogenetic development during the first year may influence leaf fracture toughness, lamina density and stem density that are relevant for herbivory resistance, leaf life span and seedling survival.
Methods Data from three experiments encompassing 104 neotropical woody species were combined. Leaf life span, lamina and vein fracture toughness, leaf and stem tissue density and seedling survival were quantified for the first-year seedlings at standardized ontogenetic stages in shade houses and common gardens established in gaps and shaded understorey in a moist tropical forest in Panama. Mortality of naturally recruited seedlings till 1 year later was quantified in 800 1-m2 plots from 1994 to 2011.
Key Results Median leaf life span ranged widely among species, always greater in shade (ranging from 151 to $>$1790 d in the understorey and shade houses) than in gaps (115\textendash{}867 d), but with strong correlation between gaps and shade. Leaf and stem tissue density increased with seedling age, whereas leaf fracture toughness showed only a weak increase. All these traits were positively correlated with leaf life span. Leaf life span and stem density were negatively correlated with seedling mortality in shade, while gap mortality showed no correlation with these traits.
Conclusions The wide spectrum of leaf life span and associated functional traits reflects variation in shade tolerance of first-year seedlings among coexisting trees, shrubs and lianas in this neotropical forest. High leaf tissue density is important in enhancing leaf toughness, a known physical defence, and leaf life span. Both seedling leaf life span and stem density should be considered as key functional traits that contribute to seedling survival in tropical forest understoreys.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.foreco.2016.09.038},
  abstract = {European beech (Fagus sylvatica) is one of the most important commercial tree species in Europe. This species is known to suffer from strong intraspecific competition for above- and below-ground resources and recent studies suggest that mixing beech with other species enhances its growth. European Beech is also known to be very sensitive to drought and natural regeneration of this species is therefore threatened under expected climate change scenarios. Whether beech regeneration under future climate conditions could be favoured in mixed forests is still unknown. In the present study, we analysed how species interactions affect the response of beech seedlings to drought. We tested the followings hypotheses: (i) competitor presence and identity impact seedling performance, and (ii) water availability influences the strength and nature of the interactions. In a greenhouse pot experiment, beech seedlings were grown either alone or in the presence of one competitor seedling (beech, sessile oak, Scots pine). A drought treatment was applied to half of the pots and the other half was well-watered. After one growing season, the seedlings were harvested and above- and below-ground growth and functional traits were measured. Under well-watered conditions, functional traits and growth allocation favouring roots indicate that competition occurred mainly for soil resources. Specific fine root length as clearly altered by the presence of pine only, probably through allelopathy or soil acidification. Drought, however, had a strong impact on beech seedling performance whatever the treatment. Drought decreased the importance of negative interactions between seedlings and a positive interaction even occurred between beech and oak. Our results suggest that under the drier climatic conditions expected in the future, naturally regenerating European beech in mixtures with oak may be advantageous for beech seedling survival and growth. In contrast, favouring regeneration or developing plantations which include beech and pine seems less advantageous.},

In this paper, we examine to what extent the spatial reconfiguration of tropical landscapes alters plant trait distributions and the spatial organization of tree assemblages. A set of 117 tree species and 1422 individuals ($\geq$10 cm DBH) inhabiting a fragmented Atlantic forest landscape in Brazil were assigned into categories of both vegetative and reproductive life-history traits, and matrices of trait frequencies were correlated to four spatial patch metrics via the concepts of trait-convergent, trait-divergent assembly pattern, and measures of functional richness, evenness, and diversity. Life form and seed dispersal syndrome exhibited the highest and significant degrees of trait-convergence related to connectivity and patch size gradients, respectively. Trait divergence based on seed dispersal syndrome and regeneration strategy emerged as well, particularly in response to patch area and connectivity. Finally, some functional diversity (multiple-traits) measures correlated with either a particular patch metric or species richness. Our results suggest that the spatial distribution of life-history traits and strategies exhibited by tree species correlate with spatial patch metrics, supporting the notion that human disturbances result in new environmental gradients able to spatially reorganize and restructure tree assemblages at broad spatial scales into human-modified landscapes.},

  abstract = {* Bayesian inference is a powerful tool to better understand ecological processes across varied subfields in ecology, and is often implemented in generic and flexible software packages such as the widely used BUGS family (BUGS, WinBUGS, OpenBUGS and JAGS). However, some models have prohibitively long run times when implemented in BUGS. A relatively new software platform called Stan uses Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), a family of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms which promise improved efficiency and faster inference relative to those used by BUGS. Stan is gaining traction in many fields as an alternative to BUGS, but adoption has been slow in ecology, likely due in part to the complex nature of HMC.

* Here, we provide an intuitive illustration of the principles of HMC on a set of simple models. We then compared the relative efficiency of BUGS and Stan using population ecology models that vary in size and complexity. For hierarchical models, we also investigated the effect of an alternative parameterization of random effects, known as non-centering.

* For small, simple models there is little practical difference between the two platforms, but Stan outperforms BUGS as model size and complexity grows. Stan also performs well for hierarchical models, but is more sensitive to model parameterization than BUGS. Stan may also be more robust to biased inference caused by pathologies, because it produces diagnostic warnings where BUGS provides none. Disadvantages of Stan include an inability to use discrete parameters, more complex diagnostics and a greater requirement for hands-on tuning.

* Given these results, Stan is a valuable tool for many ecologists utilizing Bayesian inference, particularly for problems where BUGS is prohibitively slow. As such, Stan can extend the boundaries of feasible models for applied problems, leading to better understanding of ecological processes. Fields that would likely benefit include estimation of individual and population growth rates, meta-analyses and cross-system comparisons and spatiotemporal models.},

  abstract = {* Steep climatic gradients boost morphological and physiological adjustments in plants, with consequences on performance. The three principal woody species of the Sierras Grandes Mountains of central Argentina have marked differences in sapling performance along their altitudinal distribution. We hypothesize that the steep gradient of climatic conditions across the species' altitudinal distribution promotes trait differences between populations of different altitudes that are inherited by the following generation.

* Seeds from different altitudes were exposed to three temperature regimes to assess differential germination responses. Saplings were then transplanted to a greenhouse to assess possible variations in attributes and performance after 18 months.

* The three species showed differences in germination responses to temperature among altitudes and/or in sapling attributes and performance. In Maytenus boaria and Escallonia cordobensis, germination success was higher under high temperatures for the highest-altitude, whereas lower temperatures boosted germination of the lowest altitudes. Polylepis australis showed no differences in germination among temperature treatments. In the greenhouse, saplings of the three species from intermediate altitudes showed high performance, whereas the upper and lower populations seemed to be adjusted to tolerating more stressful conditions (i.e., lower temperatures at the upper end and water stress at the lower end), showing lower performance toward both altitudinal limits.

* These patterns agree with those described for saplings growing under field conditions, suggesting adjustments in response to environmental changes undergone by populations along the altitudinal range. The marked adjustments of populations to the local environment suggest a potentially high impact of climatic change on species distribution.},

They found that forests exhibit a drought ``legacy effect'' with 3 to 4 years' reduced growth following drought. During this postdrought delay, forests will be less able to act as a sink for carbon. Incorporating forest legacy effects into Earth system models will provide more accurate predictions of the effects of drought on the global carbon cycle.
Science, this issue p. 528
The impacts of climate extremes on terrestrial ecosystems are poorly understood but important for predicting carbon cycle feedbacks to climate change. Coupled climate\textendash{}carbon cycle models typically assume that vegetation recovery from extreme drought is immediate and complete, which conflicts with the understanding of basic plant physiology. We examined the recovery of stem growth in trees after severe drought at 1338 forest sites across the globe, comprising 49,339 site-years, and compared the results with simulated recovery in climate-vegetation models. We found pervasive and substantial ``legacy effects'' of reduced growth and incomplete recovery for 1 to 4 years after severe drought. Legacy effects were most prevalent in dry ecosystems, among Pinaceae, and among species with low hydraulic safety margins. In contrast, limited or no legacy effects after drought were simulated by current climate-vegetation models. Our results highlight hysteresis in ecosystem-level carbon cycling and delayed recovery from climate extremes.
Tree-ring data from 1338 forest sites show that after a drought tree growth is reduced for a further 3 to 4 years.

Two MODIS vegetation indices (VI), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), are produced at 1-km and 500-m resolutions and 16-day compositing periods. This paper presents an initial analysis of the MODIS NDVI and EVI performance from both radiometric and biophysical perspectives. We utilize a combination of site-intensive and regionally extensive approaches to demonstrate the performance and validity of the two indices. Our results showed a good correspondence between airborne-measured, top-of-canopy reflectances and VI values with those from the MODIS sensor at four intensively measured test sites representing semi-arid grass/shrub, savanna, and tropical forest biomes. Simultaneously derived field biophysical measures also demonstrated the scientific utility of the MODIS VI. Multitemporal profiles of the MODIS VIs over numerous biome types in North and South America well represented their seasonal phenologies. Comparisons of the MODIS-NDVI with the NOAA-14, 1-km AVHRR-NDVI temporal profiles showed that the MODIS-based index performed with higher fidelity. The dynamic range of the MODIS VIs are presented and their sensitivities in discriminating vegetation differences are evaluated in sparse and dense vegetation areas. We found the NDVI to asymptotically saturate in high biomass regions such as in the Amazon while the EVI remained sensitive to canopy variations.},

  abstract = {Spatial patterns in carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles of high-latitude catchments have been linked to climate and permafrost and used to infer potential changes in biogeochemical cycles under climate warming. However, inconsistent spatial patterns across regions indicate that factors in addition to permafrost and regional climate may shape responses of C and N cycles to climate change. We hypothesized that physical attributes of catchments modify responses of C and N cycles to climate and permafrost. We measured dissolved organic C (DOC) and nitrate (NO3-) concentrations, and composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in 21 streams spanning boreal to arctic Alaska, and assessed permafrost, topography, and attributes of soils and vegetation as predictors of stream chemistry. Multiple regression analyses indicated that catchment slope is a primary driver, with lower DOC and higher NO3- concentration in streams draining steeper catchments, respectively. Depth of the active layer explained additional variation in concentration of DOC and NO3-. Vegetation type explained regional variation in concentration and composition of DOM, which was characterized by optical methods. Composition of DOM was further correlated with attributes of soils, including moisture, temperature, and thickness of the organic layer. Regional patterns of DOC and NO3- concentrations in boreal to arctic Alaska were driven primarily by catchment topography and modified by permafrost, whereas composition of DOM was driven by attributes of soils and vegetation, suggesting that predicting changes to C and N cycling from permafrost-influenced regions should consider catchment setting in addition to dynamics of climate and permafrost.},

  abstract = {South East Asia has the highest rate of lowland forest loss of any tropical region, with logging and deforestation for conversion to plantation agriculture being flagged as the most urgent threats. Detecting and mapping logging impacts on forest structure is a primary conservation concern, as these impacts feed through to changes in biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Here, we test whether high-spatial resolution satellite remote sensing can be used to map the responses of aboveground live tree biomass (AGB), canopy leaf area index (LAI) and fractional vegetation cover (FCover) to selective logging and deforestation in Malaysian Borneo. We measured these attributes in permanent vegetation plots in rainforest and oil palm plantations across the degradation landscape of the Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems project. We found significant mathematical relationships between field-measured structure and satellite-derived spectral and texture information, explaining up to 62\% of variation in biophysical structure across forest and oil palm plots. These relationships held at different aggregation levels from plots to forest disturbance types and oil palms allowing us to map aboveground biomass and canopy structure across the degradation landscape. The maps reveal considerable spatial variation in the impacts of previous logging, a pattern that was less clear when considering field data alone. Up-scaled maps revealed a pronounced decline in aboveground live tree biomass with increasing disturbance, impacts which are also clearly visible in the field data even a decade after logging. Field data demonstrate a rapid recovery in forest canopy structure with the canopy recovering to pre-disturbance levels a decade after logging. Yet, up-scaled maps show that both LAI and FCover are still reduced in logged compared to primary forest stands and markedly lower in oil palm stands. While uncertainties remain, these maps can now be utilised to identify conservation win\textendash{}wins, especially when combining them with ongoing biodiversity surveys and measurements of carbon sequestration, hydrological cycles and microclimate.},

  abstract = {Model specification remains challenging in spectroscopy of plant biochemistry, as exemplified by the availability of various spectral indices or band combinations for estimating the same biochemical. This lack of consensus in model choice across applications argues for a paradigm shift in hyperspectral methods to address model uncertainty and misspecification. We demonstrated one such method using Bayesian model averaging (BMA), which performs variable/band selection and quantifies the relative merits of many candidate models to synthesize a weighted average model with improved predictive performances. The utility of BMA was examined using a portfolio of 27 foliage spectral\textendash{}chemical datasets representing over 80 species across the globe to estimate multiple biochemical properties, including nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon, cellulose, lignin, chlorophyll (a or b), carotenoid, polar and nonpolar extractives, leaf mass per area, and equivalent water thickness. We also compared BMA with partial least squares (PLS) and stepwise multiple regression (SMR). Results showed that all the biochemicals except carotenoid were accurately estimated from hyerspectral data with R2 values \&gt; 0.80. Compared to PLS and SMR, BMA substantially reduced overfitting and enhanced model generalization; BMA also yielded error estimation better indicative of true uncertainties in predictions, when evaluated using a statistic called ``prediction interval coverage probability''. The relative band importance, which was quantified by band selection probability, differed markedly between BMA and SMR, cautioning the use of SMR for band selection. Computationally, the model calibration with datasets of moderate sizes (\&gt; 100) was faster for BMA via a hybrid reversible-jump Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampler than for PLS via literal optimization of a cross-validation criterion. Our BMA scheme also provides a generic hierarchical Bayesian framework to assimilate prior knowledge of diverse forms, as illustrated by its use to account for nonlinearity in spectral\textendash{}chemical relationships. We emphasize that BMA is a competitive, paradigm-shifting alternative to conventional statistical methods and it will find wide use as the virtue of Bayesian inference is increasingly appreciated by the remote sensing community.},

  abstract = {Forest recovery from past disturbance is an integral process of ecosystem carbon cycles, and remote sensing provides an effective tool for tracking forest disturbance and recovery over large areas. Although the disturbance products (tracking the conversion from forest to non-forest type) derived using the Landsat Time Series Stack-Vegetation Change Tracker (LTSS-VCT) algorithm have been validated extensively for mapping forest disturbances across the United States, the ability of this approach to characterize long-term post-disturbance recovery (the conversion from non-forest to forest) has yet to be assessed. In this study, the LTSS-VCT approach was applied to examine long-term (up to 24 years) post-disturbance forest spectral recovery following stand-clearing disturbances (fire and harvests) in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE). Using high spatial resolution images from Google Earth, we validated the detectable forest recovery status mapped by VCT by year 2011. Validation results show that the VCT was able to map long-term post-disturbance forest recovery with overall accuracy of \textasciitilde{}80\% for different disturbance types and forest types in the GYE. Harvested areas in the GYE have higher percentages of forest recovery than burned areas by year 2011, and National Forests land generally has higher recovery rates compared with National Parks. The results also indicate that forest recovery is highly related with forest type, elevation and environmental variables such as soil type. Findings from this study can provide valuable insights for ecosystem modeling that aim to predict future carbon dynamics by integrating fine scale forest recovery conditions in GYE, in the face of climate change. With the availability of the VCT product nationwide, this approach can also be applied to examine long-term post-disturbance forest recovery in other study regions across the U.S.},

  abstract = {Fuel moisture content (FMC) is an important variable for predicting the occurrence and spread of wildfire. Because FMC is calculated from the ratio of canopy water content to dry-matter content, we hypothesized that FMC may be estimated by remote sensing with a ratio of a vegetation water index to a vegetation dry-matter index. Four vegetation water indices, six dry-matter indices, and the resulting water/dry-matter index ratios were calculated using simulated leaf reflectances from the PROSPECT model. Two water indices, the Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII) and the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), were more correlated with leaf water content than with FMC, and were not correlated with leaf dry-matter content. Two dry-matter indices, the Normalized Dry Matter Index (NDMI) and a recent index (unnamed) were correlated to leaf dry matter content, were inversely correlated with FMC, and were not correlated with water content. Ratios of these water indices and these dry-matter indices were highly and consistently correlated with FMC. Ratios of other water indices with other dry-matter indices were not consistently correlated with FMC. The ratio of NDII with NDMI was strongly related to FMC by a quadratic polynomial equation with an R2 of 0.947. Spectral reflectance data were acquired for single leaves and leaf stacks of Quercus alba, Acer rubrum, and Zea mays; the relationship between FMC and NDII/NDMI had an R2 of 0.853 and was almost identical to the equation from the PROSPECT model simulations. For the SAIL model simulations, the relationship between NDII/NDMI and FMC at the canopy scale had an R2 of 0.900, but the quadratic polynomial equation differed from the equations determined from the PROSPECT simulations and spectral reflectance data. NDMI requires narrow-band sensors to measure the effect of dry matter on reflectance at 1722 nm whereas NDII may be determined with many different sensors. Therefore, monitoring FMC with NDII/NDMI requires either a new sensor or a combination of two sensors, one with high temporal resolution for monitoring water content and one with high spectral resolution for estimating dry-matter content.},

Despite their importance, anthropogenic activities are rapidly degrading and deforesting mangroves world-wide. Madagascar contains 2\% of the world's mangroves, many of which have undergone or are starting to exhibit signs of widespread degradation and deforestation. Remotely sensed data can be used to quantify mangrove loss and characterize remaining distributions, providing detailed, accurate, timely and updateable information. We use USGS maps produced from Landsat data to calculate nation-wide dynamics for Madagascar's mangroves from 1990 to 2010, and examine change more closely by partitioning the national distribution in to primary (i.e., \&gt;1000 ha) ecosystems; with focus on four Areas of Interest (AOIs): Ambaro-Ambanja Bays (AAB), Mahajamba Bay (MHJ), Tsiribihina Manombolo Delta (TMD) and Bay des Assassins (BdA). Results indicate a nation\textendash{}wide net-loss of 21\% (i.e., 57,359 ha) from 1990 to 2010, with dynamics varying considerably among primary mangrove ecosystems. Given the limitations of national-level maps for certain localized applications (e.g., carbon stock inventories), building on two previous studies for AAB and MHJ, we employ Landsat data to produce detailed, contemporary mangrove maps for TMD and BdA. These contemporary, AOI-specific maps provide improved detail and accuracy over the USGS national-level maps, and are being applied to conservation and restoration initiatives through the Blue Ventures' Blue Forests programme and WWF Madagascar West Indian Ocean Programme Office's work in the region.},

  abstract = {Temporally rich hyperspectral time-series can provide unique time critical information on within-field variations in vegetation health and distribution needed by farmers to effectively optimize crop production. In this study, a dense timeseries of images were acquired from the Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) Hyperion sensor over an intensive farming area in the center of Saudi Arabia. After correction for atmospheric effects, optimal links between carefully selected explanatory hyperspectral vegetation indices and target vegetation characteristics were established using a machine learning approach. A dataset of in-situ measured leaf chlorophyll (Chll) and leaf area index (LAI), collected during five intensive field campaigns over a variety of crop types, were used to train the rule-based predictive models. The ability of the narrow-band hyperspectral reflectance information to robustly assess and discriminate dynamics in foliar biochemistry and biomass through empirical relationships were investigated. This also involved evaluations of the generalization and reproducibility of the predictions beyond the conditions of the training dataset. The very high temporal resolution of the satellite retrievals constituted a specifically intriguing feature that facilitated detection of total canopy Chl and LAI dynamics down to sub-weekly intervals. The study advocates the benefits associated with the availability of optimum spectral and temporal resolution spaceborne observations for agricultural management purposes.},

  abstract = {Global mean temperature is predicted to increase by 2\textendash{}7~$^\circ$C and precipitation to change across the globe by the end of this century. To quantify climate effects on ecosystem processes, a number of climate change experiments have been established around the world in various ecosystems. Despite these efforts, general responses of terrestrial ecosystems to changes in temperature and precipitation, and especially to their combined effects, remain unclear. We used meta-analysis to synthesize ecosystem-level responses to warming, altered precipitation, and their combination. We focused on plant growth and ecosystem carbon (C) balance, including biomass, net primary production (NPP), respiration, net ecosystem exchange (NEE), and ecosystem photosynthesis, synthesizing results from 85 studies. We found that experimental warming and increased precipitation generally stimulated plant growth and ecosystem C fluxes, whereas decreased precipitation had the opposite effects. For example, warming significantly stimulated total NPP, increased ecosystem photosynthesis, and ecosystem respiration. Experimentally reduced precipitation suppressed aboveground NPP (ANPP) and NEE, whereas supplemental precipitation enhanced ANPP and NEE. Plant productivity and ecosystem C fluxes generally showed higher sensitivities to increased precipitation than to decreased precipitation. Interactive effects of warming and altered precipitation tended to be smaller than expected from additive, single-factor effects, though low statistical power limits the strength of these conclusions. New experiments with combined temperature and precipitation manipulations are needed to conclusively determine the importance of temperature\textendash{}precipitation interactions on the C balance of terrestrial ecosystems under future climate conditions.},

  abstract = {In its simplest definition, a trait is a surrogate of organismal performance, and this meaning of the term has been used by evolutionists for a long time. Over the last three decades, developments in community and ecosystem ecology have forced the concept of trait beyond these original boundaries, and trait-based approaches are now widely used in studies ranging from the level of organisms to that of ecosystems. Despite some attempts to fix the terminology, especially in plant ecology, there is currently a high degree of confusion in the use, not only of the term ``trait'' itself, but also in the underlying concepts it refers to. We therefore give an unambiguous definition of plant trait, with a particular emphasis on functional trait. A hierarchical perspective is proposed, extending the ``performance paradigm'' to plant ecology. ``Functional traits'' are defined as morpho-physio-phenological traits which impact fitness indirectly via their effects on growth, reproduction and survival, the three components of individual performance. We finally present an integrative framework explaining how changes in trait values due to environmental variations are translated into organismal performance, and how these changes may influence processes at higher organizational levels. We argue that this can be achieved by developing ``integration functions'' which can be grouped into functional response (community level) and effect (ecosystem level) algorithms.},

  abstract = {Although minerals represent important soil constituents, their impact on the diversity and structure of soil microbial communities remains poorly documented. In this study, pure mineral particles with varying chemistries (i.e., obsidian, apatite and calcite) were considered. Each mineral type was conditioned in mesh bags and incubated in soil below different tree stands (beech, coppice with standards and Corsican pine) for 2.5 years to determine the relative impact of mineralogy and mineral weatherability on the taxonomic and functional diversity of mineral-associated bacterial communities. After this incubation period, the minerals and the surrounding bulk soil were collected to determine mass loss and to perform soil analyses, enzymatic assays, and cultivation-dependent and -independent analyses. Notably, our 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing analyses revealed that, after the 2.5-year incubation period, the mineral-associated bacterial communities strongly differed from those of the surrounding bulk soil for all tree stands considered. When focusing only on minerals, our analyses showed that the bacterial communities associated with calcite, the less recalcitrant mineral type, significantly differed from those that colonized obsidian and apatite minerals. The cultivation-dependent analysis revealed significantly higher abundances of effective mineral weathering bacteria on the most recalcitrant minerals (i.e., apatite and obsidian). Together, our data showed an enrichment of Betaproteobacteria and effective mineral weathering bacteria related to the Burkholderia and Collimonas genera on the minerals, suggesting a key role for these taxa in mineral weathering and nutrient cycling in nutrient-poor forest ecosystems.
IMPORTANCE Forests are usually developed on nutrient-poor and rocky soils, while nutrient-rich soils have been dedicated to agriculture. In this context, nutrient recycling and nutrient access are key processes in such environments. Deciphering how soil mineralogy influences the diversity, structure and function of soil bacterial communities in relation to the soil conditions is crucial to better understanding the relative role of the soil bacterial communities in nutrient cycling and plant nutrition in nutrient-poor environments. The present study determined in detail the diversity and structure of bacterial communities associated with different mineral types incubated for 2.5 years in the soil under different tree species using cultivation-dependent and -independent analyses. Our data showed an enrichment of specific bacterial taxa on the minerals, specifically on the most weathered minerals, suggesting that they play key roles in mineral weathering and nutrient cycling in nutrient-poor forest ecosystems.},

The comparison of composites for the early period (1915\textendash{}60) and the recent period (1962\textendash{}2006) indicates that cooling (warming) over the south and warming (cooling) over the north during ENSO warm (cold) winters have been weakening. The ENSO influence on winter P over the Southwest is strengthening, while the impact on P over the Ohio Valley is weakening for the recent decades. These differences are not due to the long-term trends in Tair or P; they are attributed to the occurrence of the central Pacific (CPAC) ENSO events in the recent years. The CPAC ENSO differs from the canonical eastern Pacific (EPAC) ENSO. The EPAC ENSO has a sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) maximum in the eastern Pacific. Enhanced convection extends from the date line to the eastern Pacific, with negative anomalies in the western Pacific. The atmospheric responses resemble a tropical Northern Hemisphere pattern. The wave train is consistent with the north\textendash{}south Tair contrast over North America during the EPAC ENSO winters. The CPAC ENSO has enhanced convection in the central Pacific. The atmospheric responses show a Pacific\textendash{}North American pattern.

As Plasmopara viticola produces sporangia on the abaxial surface of susceptible cultivars, disease symptoms on both leaf sides may be detected and quantified by technical sensors. The response of cultivars `Mueller-Thurgau', `Regent', and `Solaris', which differ in resistance to P. viticola, was characterized under controlled conditions by using hyperspectral sensors. Spectral reflectance was suitable to differentiate between non-infected cultivars and leaf sides of the bicolored grapevine. Brown discoloration of tissue became visible on both leaf sides of resistant cultivars 2 days before downy mildew symptoms appeared on the susceptible `Mueller-Thurgau' cultivar. Infection of this cultivar resulted in significant (P$<$0.05) reflectance changes 1\textendash{}2 days prior to abaxial sporulation induced by high relative humidity, or the formation of adaxial oil spots. Hyperspectral imaging was more sensitive in disease detection than non-imaging and provided spatial information on the leaf level. Spectral indices provided information on the variability of chlorophyll content, photosynthetic activity, and relative water content of leaf tissue in time and space. On `Mueller-Thurgau' downy mildew translated reflectance to higher values as detectable by the index DMI\_3=(R470+R682+R800)/(R800/R682) and affected reflectance at 1450nm. Tissue discoloration on `Regent' and `Solaris' cultivars was associated with lower reflectance between 750 and 900nm; blue and red reflectance demonstrated differences from leaf necroses. With high inoculum densities, P. viticola sporulated on even resistant cultivars. Hyperspectral characterization at the tissue level proved suitable for phenotyping plant resistance to pathogens and provided information on resistance mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Radiation reflected from vegetation canopies exhibits high spatial variation. Satellite-borne sensors measure the mean intensities emanating from heterogeneous vegetated pixels. The theory of radiative transfer in stochastic media provides the most logical linkage between satellite observations and the three-dimensional canopy structure through a closed system of simple equations which contains the mean intensity and higher statistical moments directly as its unknowns. Although this theory has been a highly active research field in recent years, its potential for satellite remote sensing of vegetated surfaces has not been fully realized because of the lack of models of a canopy pair-correlation function that the stochastic radiative transfer equations require. The pair correlation function is defined as the probability of finding simultaneously phytoelements at two points. This paper presents analytical and Monte Carlo generated pair correlation functions. Theoretical and numerical analyses show that the spatial correlation between phytoelements is primarily responsible for the effects of the three-dimensional canopy structure on canopy reflective and absorptive properties. The pair correlation function, therefore, is the most natural and physically meaningful measure of the canopy structure over a wide range of scales. The stochastic radiative transfer equations naturally admit this measure and thus provide a powerful means to investigate the three-dimensional canopy structure from space. Canopy reflectances predicted by the stochastic equations are assessed by comparisons with the PARABOLA measurements from coniferous and broadleaf forest stands in the BOREAS Southern Study Areas. The pair correlation functions are derived from data on tree structural parameters collected during field campaigns conducted at these sites. The simulated canopy reflectances compare well with the PARABOLA data.},

  abstract = {The extent to which current landscapes deviate from the historical range of natural variability (RNV) is a common means of defining and ranking regional conservation targets. However, climate-induced shifts in forest composition may render obsolete restoration strategies and conservation targets based on historic climate conditions and disturbance regimes. We used a spatially explicit forest ecosystem model, LANDIS-II, to simulate the interaction of climate change and forest management in northeastern Minnesota, USA. We assessed the relevance of restoration strategies and conservation targets based on the RNV in the context of future climate change. Three climate scenarios (no climate change, low emissions, and high emissions) were simulated with three forest management scenarios: no harvest, current management, and a restoration-based approach where harvest activity mimicked the frequency, severity, and size distribution of historic natural disturbance regimes. Under climate change there was a trend toward homogenization of forest conditions due to the widespread expansion of systems dominated by maple (Acer spp.). White spruce (Picea glauca), balsam fir (Abies balsamea), and paper birch (Betula papyrifera) were extirpated from the landscape irrespective of management activity; additional losses of black spruce (P. mariana), red pine (Pinus resinosa), and jack pine (P. banksiana) were projected in the high-emissions scenario. In the restoration management scenario, retention and conversion to white pine (P. strobus) restricted maple expansion. But, widespread forest loss in the restoration scenario under high-emissions projections illustrates the potential pitfalls of implementing an RNV management approach in a system that is not compositionally similar to the historic reference condition. Given the uncertainty associated with climate change, ensuring a diversity of species and conditions within forested landscapes may be the most effective means of ensuring the future resistance of ecosystems to climate-induced declines in productivity.},

  abstract = {Fire is a keystone process in many ecosystems of western North America. Severe fires kill and consume large amounts of above- and belowground biomass and affect soils, resulting in long-lasting consequences for vegetation, aquatic ecosystem productivity and diversity, and other ecosystem properties. We analyzed the occurrence of, and trends in, satellite-derived burn severity across six ecoregions in the Southwest and Northwest regions of the United States from 1984 to 2006 using data from the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity project. Using 1,024 fires from the Northwest (4,311,871 ha) and 497 fires from the Southwest (1,434,670 ha), we examined the relative influence of fine-scale topography and coarse-scale weather and climate on burn severity (the degree of change from before the fire to one year after) using the Random Forest machine learning algorithm. Together, topography, climate, and weather explained severe fire occurrence with classification accuracies ranging from 68\% to 84\%. Topographic variables were relatively more important predictors of severe fire occurrence than either climate or weather variables. Predictability of severe fire was consistently lower during years with widespread fires, suggesting that local control exerted by topography may be overwhelmed by regional climatic controls when fires burn in dry conditions. Annually, area burned severely was strongly correlated with area burned in all ecoregions (Pearson's correlation 0.86\textendash{}0.97; p $<$ 0.001), while the proportion of area burned severely was significantly correlated with area burned only in two ecoregions (p $\leq$ 0.037). During our short time series, only ecoregions in the Southwest showed evidence of a significant increase (p $\leq$ 0.036) in annual area burned and area burned severely, and annual proportion burned severely increased in just one of the three Southwest ecoregions. We suggest that predictive mapping of the potential for severe fire is possible, and will be improved with climate data at the scale of the topographic and Landsat-derived burn severity data. Although severity is a value-laden term implying negative ecosystem effects, we stress that severity can be objectively measured and recognize that high severity fire is an important ecological process within the historical range of variability in some ecosystems.},

We propose a new vegetation index for biomass estimation of short vegetation, to improve the saturation problem using the red-edge bands. By using the Hyper-spectral image data of Maize and Soybean, the nine well-known vegetation indices are evaluated and compared with the proposed index. For validation of the proposed model using Sentinel-2 data, Pereira allometric data is used (r-square is 0.765).},

To date, however, this goal has not been fully realized. In this study, fresh-leaf reflectance spectroscopy ($\lambda$=450\textendash{}2500 nm) and a partial least-squares regression (PLSR) analysis were used to estimate key determinants of photosynthetic capacity\textemdash{}namely the maximum rates of RuBP carboxylation (Vcmax) and regeneration (Jmax)\textemdash{}measured with standard gas exchange techniques on leaves of trembling aspen and eastern cottonwood trees. The trees were grown across an array of glasshouse temperature regimes. The PLSR models yielded accurate and precise estimates of Vcmax and Jmax within and across species and glasshouse temperatures. These predictions were developed using unique contributions from different spectral regions. Most of the wavelengths selected were correlated with known absorption features related to leaf water content, nitrogen concentration, internal structure, and/or photosynthetic enzymes. In a field application of our PLSR models, spectral reflectance data effectively captured the short-term temperature sensitivities of Vcmax and Jmax in aspen foliage. These findings highlight a promising strategy for developing remote sensing methods to characterize dynamic, environmentally sensitive aspects of canopy photosynthetic metabolism at broad scales.},

Both are useful sources of information for analyzing and monitoring ecosystem responses to environmental variations caused by natural and anthropogenic drivers. In the semi-arid region of Chile, climate variability and recent severe droughts in addition to land-use changes pose threats to the stability of local ecosystems. Normalized difference vegetation index time series (2000\textendash{}2013) data from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) was processed to monitor the trends and patterns of vegetation productivity and phenology observed over the last decade. An analysis of the relationship between (i) vegetation productivity and (ii) precipitation and temperature data for representative natural land-use cover classes was made. Using these data and ground measurements, productivity estimates were projected for two climate change scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5) at two altitudinal levels. Results showed negative trends of vegetation productivity below 2000 m a.s.l. and positive trends for higher elevations. Phenology analysis suggested that mountainous ecosystems were starting their growing period earlier in the season, coinciding with a decreased productivity peak during the growing season. The coastal shrubland/grassland land cover class had a significant positive relation with rainfall and a significant negative relation with temperature, suggesting that these ecosystems are vulnerable to climate change. Future productivity projections indicate that under an RCP8.5 climate change scenario, productivity could decline by 12\% in the period of 2060\textendash{}2100, leading to a severe vegetation degradation at lower altitudes and in drier areas.},

  abstract = {* 1We present evidence of trade-offs in competitive ability among five perennial C4 grass species at different levels of soil fertility and disturbance in a garden experiment in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.
* 2Our goals were to examine plant strategy theory, using grass species that differed widely in various traits and in their response to environmental influences. More specifically, we wished to examine whether the importance of competition was less in low fertility or regularly disturbed environments (stressed environments) than in more fertile or undisturbed conditions, and whether species made trade-offs in competitive ability along such stress gradients.
* 3The trend in the competitive ability of two species in mixture along a soil fertility gradient tended to be inversely related if one had narrow and the other broad leaves or they differed in height, providing strong evidence for trait trade-offs. Thus, a tall broad-leaved species, Panicum maximum, was the most competitive species in fertile subplots, whereas a tall narrow-leaved species, Hyparrhenia hirta, was the most competitive species in infertile subplots, but no difference in competitive ability across a fertility gradient was observed when both species in a mixture had similar traits.
* 4Regular cutting altered competitive interactions amongst species resulting in a short species, Themeda triandra, having a greater competitive effect on neighbours and a better response to neighbours in cut than in the less stressed uncut treatments, suggesting a trade-off for competitive ability in regularly disturbed habitats. However, cutting only improved the performance of T. triandra against P. maximum in infertile subplots.
* 5We demonstrated that for some, but not all, mixtures of species, competitive hierarchies may reverse along gradients of soil fertility and disturbance. Moreover, soil fertility and disturbance may interact in their effect on competitive interactions. Thus, soil fertility and disturbance form the major axes of an ecological framework for understanding plant competitive interactions.},

  abstract = {With global population projected to approach 9 billion by 2050, it has been estimated that a 40\% increase in cereal production will be required to satisfy the worlds growing nutritional demands. Any such increases in agricultural productivity are likely to occur within a system that has limited room for growth and in a world with a climate that is different from that of today. Fundamental to achieving food and water security, is the capacity to monitor the health and condition of agricultural systems. While space-agency based satellites have provided the backbone for earth observation over the last few decades, many developments in the field of high-resolution earth observation have been advanced by the commercial sector. These advances relate not just to technological developments in the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), but also the advent of nano-satellite constellations that offer a radical shift in the way earth observations are now being retrieved. Such technologies present opportunities for improving our description of the water, energy and carbon cycles. Efforts towards developing new observational techniques and interpretative frameworks are required to provide the tools and information needed to improve the management and security of agricultural and related sectors. These developments are one of the surest ways to better manage, protect and preserve national food and water resources. Here we review the capabilities of recently deployed satellite systems and UAVs and examine their potential for application in precision agriculture.},

Landsat 8 extends the remarkable 40 year Landsat record and has enhanced capabilities including new spectral bands in the blue and cirrus cloud-detection portion of the spectrum, two thermal bands, improved sensor signal-to-noise performance and associated improvements in radiometric resolution, and an improved duty cycle that allows collection of a significantly greater number of images per day. This paper introduces the current (2012\textendash{}2017) Landsat Science Team's efforts to establish an initial understanding of Landsat 8 capabilities and the steps ahead in support of priorities identified by the team. Preliminary evaluation of Landsat 8 capabilities and identification of new science and applications opportunities are described with respect to calibration and radiometric characterization; surface reflectance; surface albedo; surface temperature, evapotranspiration and drought; agriculture; land cover, condition, disturbance and change; fresh and coastal water; and snow and ice. Insights into the development of derived `higher-level' Landsat products are provided in recognition of the growing need for consistently processed, moderate spatial resolution, large area, long-term terrestrial data records for resource management and for climate and global change studies. The paper concludes with future prospects, emphasizing the opportunities for land imaging constellations by combining Landsat data with data collected from other international sensing systems, and consideration of successor Landsat mission requirements.},

Although plant traits are known to vary both between and within species, little is known about the role of intraspecific trait variability in the non-random assembly mechanisms controlling the coexistence of species, including habitat filtering and niche differentiation. 2.\hspace{0.6em}We investigate the role of intraspecific variability in three key functional traits \textendash{} specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and height \textendash{} in structuring grassland communities distributed along a flooding gradient.

LDMC did not vary along the gradient, with and without accounting for intraspecific variability. Our null model approach revealed significant patterns of habitat filtering and niche differentiation for SLA and height, but not for LDMC. More strikingly, considering intraspecific trait variability greatly increased the detection of habitat filtering and was necessary to detect niche differentiation processes. 4.\hspace{0.6em}Synthesis. Our study provides evidence for a strong role of intraspecific trait variability in community assembly. Our findings suggest that intraspecific trait variability promotes species coexistence, by enabling species to pass through both abiotic and biotic filters.

  abstract = {Remote sensing techniques offer a unique solution for mapping stress and monitoring its time-course. This article reviews the main issues to be addressed for quantifying stress level from remote sensing observations, and to mitigate its impact on crop production by managing cultural practices. The case of nitrogen fertilization is used here as a paradigm. The derivation of canopy state variables such as the leaf area index (LAI) and chlorophyll content (Cab) is first addressed. It is demonstrated that the inversion of radiative transfer models leads to useful estimates of these variables. However, because of the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem, better accuracy is achieved when using prior information on the distribution of the variables and when multiplying LAI by Cab to get canopy level chlorophyll content. This variable, LAI\texttimes{}Cab is well suited for quantifying canopy level nitrogen content. It is used for nitrogen stress evaluation by comparison with a reference unstressed situation which is, however, not easy to get in practice. The combination of remote sensing observations with crop models provides an elegant solution for stress quantification through assimilation approaches. It fuses several sources of information within our knowledge of the processes involved and accounts for the environmental budget which can be integrated when making decisions about cultural practices. Conclusions are drawn on the issues related to the retrieval of canopy state variables from remote sensing data, to the link between these observables and crop models, and to the assimilation approaches. Avenues for further research are finally discussed along with the required observation system.},

It was found that the forest area has been decreasing throughout the study period in each state of the region since the 1980s. A total of 386 657 $\pm$ 98 137 ha (95\% confidence interval) of forest has been converted to other land covers since 1985. Mainly driven by low density residential development, the deforestation accelerated in the mid-1990s until 2007 when it plateaued as a result of declining new residential construction and in turn, the financial crisis of 2007\textendash{}08. The area of forest harvest, estimated at 226 519 $\pm$ 66 682 ha, was mapped separately and excluded from the deforestation estimate, while the area of forest expansion on non-forested lands was found to not be significantly different from zero. New England is often held as a principal example of a forest transition with historical widespread deforestation followed by recovery of forestlands as farming activities diminished, but the results of this study support the notion of a reversal of the forest transition as the region again is experiencing widespread deforestation. All available Landsat imagery acquired after 1985 for the study area were collected and used in the analysis. Areas of land cover and land change were estimated from a random sample of reference observations stratified by a twelve-class land change map encompassing the entire study area and period. The statistical analysis revealed that the net change in forest area and the associated modeled impact on the terrestrial carbon balance would have been considerably different if the results of the map were used without inferring the area of forest change by analysis of a reference sample.},

* 2Our results were based on both literature and original data. There were a total of 160 and 87 data points for the leaf-level and whole-plant data, respectively.
* 3Our multiple regression for single leaves was ln(AM)~=~0$\cdot$66~+~0$\cdot$71~ln(SLA)~+ 0$\cdot$79~ln(NM), r2~=~-0$\cdot$80; only the intercept (0$\cdot$11) differed for the whole-plant data. These results are not significantly different from previously published relationships.
* 4We then converted the mechanistic model of Evans and Poorter, and a modified version which includes leaf lamina thickness (T) and leaf dry matter (tissue) concentration (CM), into directed acyclic graphs. We then derived reduced graphs that involved only T, CM, SLA, NM and AM. These were tested using structural equation modelling, with measured lamina thickness (T${'}$) and leaf dry matter ratio (LDMR, g dry mass g-1 fresh mass) as indicators of T and CM. The original Evans\textendash{}Poorter model was rejected, but the modified version fitted the structural relationships well. The same qualitative models also applied to the whole-plant data, although the path coefficients sometimes differed.
* 5Using simulations, we show that the original Evans\textendash{}Poorter model predicts a positive correlation between SLA and NM that maximizes AM. The data closely follow this predicted relationship. The correlation between the actual values of AM (standardized units) and the predicted values obtained from the modified Evans\textendash{}Poorter model was 0$\cdot$74 and increased to 0$\cdot$82 once three outlier points were removed.
* 6These results provide a mechanistic explanation for the empirical trends relating leaf form and carbon fixation, and predict that SLA and leaf N must be quantitatively co-ordinated to maximize C fixation.},

  abstract = {Trait predictions from leaf spectral properties are mainly applied to tree species, while herbaceous systems received little attention in this topic. Whether similar trait\textendash{}spectrum relations can be derived for herbaceous plants that differ strongly in growing strategy and environmental constraints is therefore unknown. We used partial least squares regression to relate key traits to leaf spectra (reflectance, transmittance, and absorbance) for 35 herbaceous species, sampled from a wide range of environmental conditions. Specific Leaf Area and nutrient-related traits (N and P content) were poorly predicted from any spectrum, although N prediction improved when expressed on a per area basis (mg/m2 leaf surface) instead of mass basis (mg/g dry matter). Leaf dry matter content was moderately to good correlated with spectra. We explain our results by the range of environmental constraints encountered by herbaceous species; both N and P limitations as well as a range of light and water availabilities occurred. This weakened the relation between the measured response traits and the leaf constituents that are truly responsible for leaf spectral behavior. Indeed, N predictions improve considering solely upper or under canopy species. Therefore, trait predictions in herbaceous systems should focus on traits relating to dry matter content and the true, underlying drivers of spectral properties.},

This involves observations at different spatial, spectral, temporal and angular resolutions, etc. Furthermore, using timely data is of much importance for vegetation monitoring in environmental modeling. While the other necessary variables for such models can be collected daily (e.g. meteorological variables), the temporal resolution of optical sensors (high to intermediate spatial resolutions) does not allow having temporally frequent products of vegetation characteristics due to the revisit time of the sensors and cloud coverage. A multi-temporal, multi-sensor approach applied to a temporal sequence of radiometric data acquired by different sensors can improve mapping and monitoring of vegetation state variables over time. Even when no observations are available due to cloudiness or orbital configuration, the prior retrievals are taken.

The study provides a prototype proof of concept for a multi-temporal, multi-sensor approach to retrieve vegetation state variables using data collected by different imaging spectral-radiometers over time. Focus is given to the retrieval of LAI, fCover and chlorophyll content over the agricultural test site in Barrax, Spain. The approach is evaluated over a limited number of remotely sensed data acquired during a short period in the Sentinel-3 Experiment (SEN3EXP 2009) field campaign. A variety of satellite observations including CHRIS-Proba, Landsat TM and ASTER are integrated and combined by means of the multi-temporal, multi-sensor approach and through inversion of a coupled surface-atmosphere radiative transfer model. We applied the iterative Bayesian model inversion in which retrievals of the current observation are incorporated as prior information to the successor observation.

This paper presents an overview of the results and challenges in utilizing the multi-temporal, multi-sensor approach and the Bayesian inversion technique in the retrieval of terrestrial vegetation properties. Overall, the accuracy obtained with data acquired by multiple sensors over time was higher than when using a single sensor. LAI and fCover were retrieved with RMSE = 0.7 (m2/m2) and 0.1 respectively (multiple sensors), while RMSE = 1.09 (m2/m2) and 0.15 respectively, when using data acquired by a single sensor.},

  abstract = {Herbivory by domestic and wild ungulates is a major driver of global vegetation dynamics. However, grazing is not considered in dynamic global vegetation models, or more generally in studies of the effects of environmental change on ecosystems at regional to global scale. An obstacle to this is a lack of empirical tests of several hypotheses linking plant traits with grazing. We, therefore, set out to test whether some widely recognized trait responses to grazing are consistent at the global level. We conducted a meta-analysis of plant trait responses to grazing, based on 197 studies from all major regions of the world, and using six major conceptual models of trait response to grazing as a framework. Data were available for seven plant traits: life history, canopy height, habit, architecture, growth form (forb, graminoid, herbaceous legume, woody), palatability, and geographic origin. Covariates were precipitation and evolutionary history of herbivory. Overall, grazing favoured annual over perennial plants, short plants over tall plants, prostrate over erect plants, and stoloniferous and rosette architecture over tussock architecture. There was no consistent effect of grazing on growth form. Some response patterns were modified by particular combinations of precipitation and history of herbivory. Climatic and historical contexts are therefore essential for understanding plant trait responses to grazing. Our study identifies some key traits to be incorporated into plant functional classifications for the explicit consideration of grazing into global vegetation models used in global change research. Importantly, our results suggest that plant functional type classifications and response rules need to be specific to regions with different climate and herbivory history.},

  abstract = {Climate models predict, and empirical evidence confirms, that more extreme precipitation regimes are occurring in tandem with warmer atmospheric temperatures. These more extreme rainfall patterns are characterized by increased event size separated by longer within season drought periods and represent novel climatic conditions whose consequences for different ecosystem types are largely unknown. Here, we present results from an experiment in which more extreme rainfall patterns were imposed in three native grassland sites in the Central Plains Region of North America, USA. Along this 600~km precipitation\textendash{}productivity gradient, there was strong sensitivity of temperate grasslands to more extreme growing season rainfall regimes, with responses of aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) contingent on mean soil water levels for different grassland types. At the mesic end of the gradient (tallgrass prairie), longer dry intervals between events led to extended periods of below-average soil water content, increased plant water stress and reduced ANPP by 18\%. The opposite response occurred at the dry end (semiarid steppe), where a shift to fewer, but larger, events increased periods of above-average soil water content, reduced seasonal plant water stress and resulted in a 30\% increase in ANPP. At an intermediate mixed grass prairie site with high plant species richness, ANPP was most sensitive to more extreme rainfall regimes (70\% increase). These results highlight the inherent complexity in predicting how terrestrial ecosystems will respond to forecast novel climate conditions as well as the difficulties in extending inferences from single site experiments across biomes. Even with no change in annual precipitation amount, ANPP responses in a relatively uniform physiographic region differed in both magnitude and direction in response to within season changes in rainfall event size/frequency.},

  abstract = {Classical biogeographical observations suggest that ecosystems are strongly shaped by climatic constraints in terms of their structure and function. On the other hand, vegetation function feeds back on the climate system via biosphere\textendash{}atmosphere exchange of matter and energy. Ecosystem-level observations of this exchange reveal very large functional biogeographical variation of climate-relevant ecosystem functional properties related to carbon and water cycles. This variation is explained insufficiently by climate control and a classical plant functional type classification approach. For example, correlations between seasonal carbon-use efficiency and climate or environmental variables remain below 0.6, leaving almost 70\% of variance unexplained. We suggest that a substantial part of this unexplained variation of ecosystem functional properties is related to variations in plant and microbial traits. Therefore, to progress with global functional biogeography, we should seek to understand the link between organismic traits and flux-derived ecosystem properties at ecosystem observation sites and the spatial variation of vegetation traits given geoecological covariates. This understanding can be fostered by synergistic use of both data-driven and theory-driven ecological as well as biophysical approaches.},

There is increasing electronic access to vast sets of occurrence records in museums and herbaria, yet little effective guidance on how best to use this information in the context of numerous approaches for modelling distributions. To meet this need, we compared 16 modelling methods over 226 species from 6 regions of the world, creating the most comprehensive set of model comparisons to date. We used presence-only data to fit models, and independent presence-absence data to evaluate the predictions. Along with well-established modelling methods such as generalised additive models and GARP and BIOCLIM, we explored methods that either have been developed recently or have rarely been applied to modelling species' distributions. These include machine-learning methods and community models, both of which have features that may make them particularly well suited to noisy or sparse information, as is typical of species' occurrence data. Presence-only data were effective for modelling species' distributions for many species and regions. The novel methods consistently outperformed more established methods. The results of our analysis are promising for the use of data from museums and herbaria, especially as methods suited to the noise inherent in such data improve.},

Recent technological development has made it possible to gather invaluable data at a variety of spatial and ecological scales. Despite our ability to observe phenological change at multiple scales, the mechanistic basis of phenology is still not well understood. Integration of multiple disciplines, including ecology, evolutionary biology, climate science, and remote sensing, with long-term monitoring data across multiple spatial scales is needed to advance understanding of phenology. We review the mechanisms and major drivers of plant phenology, including temperature, photoperiod, and winter chilling, as well as other factors such as competition, resource limitation, and genetics. Shifts in plant phenology have significant consequences on ecosystem productivity, carbon cycling, competition, food webs, and other ecosystem functions and services. We summarize recent advances in observation techniques across multiple spatial scales, including digital repeat photography, other complementary optical measurements, and solar-induced fluorescence, to assess our capability to address the importance of these scale-dependent drivers. Then, we review phenology models as an important component of earth system modeling. We find that the lack of species-level knowledge and observation data leads to difficulties in the development of vegetation phenology models at ecosystem or community scales. Finally, we recommend further research to advance understanding of the mechanisms governing phenology and the standardization of phenology observation methods across networks. With the opportunity for ``big data'' collection for plant phenology, we envision a breakthrough in process-based phenology modeling.},

A largely deciduous ecosystem has been suggested as a possible landscape for future Arctic vegetation and is seen in paleo-records of warm times in the past. Here we use a global climate model with an interactive terrestrial biosphere to investigate the effects of adding deciduous trees on bare ground at high northern latitudes. We find that the top-of-atmosphere radiative imbalance from enhanced transpiration (associated with the expanded forest cover) is up to 1.5 times larger than the forcing due to albedo change from the forest. Furthermore, the greenhouse warming by additional water vapor melts sea-ice and triggers a positive feedback through changes in ocean albedo and evaporation. Land surface albedo change is considered to be the dominant mechanism by which trees directly modify climate at high-latitudes, but our findings suggest an additional mechanism through transpiration of water vapor and feedbacks from the ocean and sea-ice.},

* 2Congeneric species pairs from 14 different taxonomic families were studied, each with a savanna species and a forest species present at the study site. Only individuals growing in savanna conditions under full sun were studied. We measured foliar nutrients, $\delta$13C, $\delta$15N and specific leaf area (SLA: leaf area per unit leaf mass). We used phylogenetically independent contrasts to compare savanna and forest species and to test for correlations among species traits.
* 3Overall, leaves of forest species had 17\% higher N concentration, 32\% higher P concentration, and 37\% higher K concentration, despite growing in similar soils. Concentrations of all three elements were strongly and positively correlated with SLA.
* 4Forest species had 52\% greater SLA, on average, than savanna species, which accounts for the higher foliar nutrient concentrations of these species.
* 5Savanna species had higher $\delta$13C values than forest species, indicating higher water-use efficiency. The SLA was negatively correlated with $\delta$13C, suggesting that SLA may also account for the higher water-use efficiency of savanna species.
* 6There was no difference in foliar $\delta$15N between savanna and forest species, but foliar $\delta$15N was negatively correlated with soil pH.

This hypothesis was tested in lowland Bornean rain forest by combining measurements of leaf traits, soil nutrients and the distribution of tree species in the Dipterocarpaceae across a nutrient gradient. Nine species were studied, comprising four related pairs in Shorea (phylogenetic independent contrasts; PICs) and one habitat generalist (Dipterocarpus sublamellatus). Lamina area, specific leaf area (SLA), leaf nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) were measured for $\sim$10 saplings of each species; habitat associations were defined as a continuous function of soil nutrients and categorically in relation to substrate. Species distributions and traits varied significantly with soil nutrients. When all species were pooled, SLA and leaf P increased significantly with species' distribution across the nutrient gradient; leaf N showed the same trend. Trait shifts with habitat were stronger and more pervasive when habitat was defined categorically \textendash{} in all four PICs, rich-soil specialists had larger leaves, higher SLA, leaf N and P, and lower N:P ratios. Trait shifts with habitat at least partly reflect intrinsic differences between species. Within Shorea, variation in lamina area and N:P ratio were more strongly related to phylogeny than habitat, whereas the reverse held for SLA and leaf P. Phylogeny also influenced the extent of trait divergence between related species on different soils, and patterns of trait correlation within lineages. Results support the hypothesis that niche processes influence the distribution of species and traits in lowland tropical tree communities, and highlight the value of phylogenetic information for increasing the power of comparative studies.},

  abstract = {Phenotypic traits and their associated trade-offs have been shown to have globally consistent effects on individual plant physiological functions, but how these effects scale up to influence competition, a key driver of community assembly in terrestrial vegetation, has remained unclear. Here we use growth data from more than 3 million trees in over 140,000 plots across the world to show how three key functional traits\textemdash{}wood density, specific leaf area and maximum height\textemdash{}consistently influence competitive interactions. Fast maximum growth of a species was correlated negatively with its wood density in all biomes, and positively with its specific leaf area in most biomes. Low wood density was also correlated with a low ability to tolerate competition and a low competitive effect on neighbours, while high specific leaf area was correlated with a low competitive effect. Thus, traits generate trade-offs between performance with competition versus performance without competition, a fundamental ingredient in the classical hypothesis that the coexistence of plant species is enabled via differentiation in their successional strategies. Competition within species was stronger than between species, but an increase in trait dissimilarity between species had little influence in weakening competition. No benefit of dissimilarity was detected for specific leaf area or wood density, and only a weak benefit for maximum height. Our trait-based approach to modelling competition makes generalization possible across the forest ecosystems of the world and their highly diverse species composition.},

  abstract = {In landscapes subject to intensive agriculture, both soil fertility and vegetation disturbance are capable of impacting strongly, evenly and simultaneously on the herbaceous plant cover and each tends to impose uniformity on the traits of constituent species. In more natural and ancient grasslands greater spatial and temporal variation in both productivity and disturbance occurs and both factors have been implicated in the maintenance of species-richness in herbaceous communities. However, empirical data suggest that disturbance is the more potent driver of trait differentiation and species co-existence at a local scale. This may arise from the great diversity in opportunities for establishment, growth or reproduction that arise when the intensity of competition is reduced by damage to the vegetation. In contrast to the diversifying effects of local disturbances, productivity-related plant traits (growth rate, leaf longevity, leaf chemistry, leaf toughness, decomposition rate) appear to be less variable on a local scale. This difference in the effects of the productivity and disturbance filters arises from the relative constancy of productivity within the community and the diversity in agency and in spatial and temporal scales exhibited by disturbance events. Also, evolutionary responses to disturbances involve minor adaptive shifts in phenological and regenerative traits and are more likely to occur as micro-evolutionary steps than the shifts in linked traits in the core physiology associated with the capacity to exploit productive and unproductive habitats. During the assembly of a community and over its subsequent lifespan filters with diversifying and convergent effects may operate simultaneously on recruitment from the local species pool and impose contrasted effects on the similarity of the trait values exhibited by co-existing species. Moreover, as a consequence of the frequent association of productivity with the convergence filter, an additional difference is predicted in terms of the effects of the two filters on ecosystem functioning. Convergence in traits selected by the productivity filter will exert effects on both the plant community and the ecosystem while divergent effects of the disturbance filter will be restricted to the plant community.},

Individual leaf and litter characteristics are good predictors of decomposition rates within biomes worldwide, but knowledge of which traits are the best predictors for tropical species remains scarce.

In addition, land use change is the most immediate and widespread global change driver, with potentially significant consequences for decomposition. 2.\hspace{0.6em}Here we evaluate 14 leaf and litter traits, and litter decomposition rates of 23 plant species from three different land use types (mature forest, secondary forest and agricultural field) in the moist tropics of lowland Bolivia. 3.\hspace{0.6em}Leaf and litter traits were closely associated and showed, in line with the LES, a slow\textendash{}fast continuum ranging from species with tough, well-protected leaves (high leaf density, leaf dry matter content, force to punch and litter C~:~N ratio) to species with cheap, productive leaves [high specific leaf area (SLA) and nutrient concentrations in leaves and litter]. 4.\hspace{0.6em}Fresh green leaf traits were better predictors of decomposition rate than litter traits, and leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) was a better predictor of decomposition than leaf phosphorus concentration, despite the widely held belief that tropical forests are P-limited. 5.\hspace{0.6em}Multiple regression analysis showed that LNC, SLA and chlorophyll content per unit leaf area had positive effects on decomposition, explaining together 65\textendash{}69\% of the variation. Species position on the LES and regeneration light requirements were also positively related to decomposition. 6.\hspace{0.6em}Plant communities from agricultural fields had significantly higher LNC and SLA than communities from mature forest and secondary forest.

  abstract = {Forest biogeochemistry is strongly determined by the interaction between the tree community and the topsoil. Functional strategies of tree species are coupled to specific chemical leaf traits, and thus also to litter composition, which affects mineral soil characteristics. The limited understanding on this interaction is mainly based on shorter-term common garden experiments in temperate forest, and needs to be extended to other forest types and climates if we want to understand the universality of this linkage. In particular, for highly diverse tropical forests, our understanding of this interaction remains limited. Using an old experimental plantation within the central Congo basin, we examined the relationship between leaf and litter chemical composition and topsoil properties. Canopy, litter and topsoil characteristics were measured and we determined how the community-level leaf and litter chemical composition altered the topsoil carbon, major plant nutrients and exchangeable cation concentration, acidity and pH over the last eight decades. We found that functional composition strongly affected topsoil pH. In turn, topsoil pH strongly determined the soil total carbon and available phosphorus, total nitrogen and exchangeable potassium. Our results indicate that, as observed in temperate common garden experiments, trees alter chemical topsoil properties primarily through soil acidification, differently induced by functional composition of the tree community. The strong link between this community-level composition and topsoil characteristics, on a highly representative soil type for the tropics, improves our understanding of tropical forests biogeochemistry.},

Hyperspectral images can detect tree canopy properties, including species identity, leaf chemistry and disease. Tree growth rates are related to these measurable canopy properties but whether growth can be directly predicted from hyperspectral data remains unknown. We used a single hyperspectral image and light detection and ranging-derived elevation to predict growth rates for 20 tropical tree species planted in experimental plots. We asked whether a consistent relationship between spectral data and growth rates exists across all species and which spectral regions, associated with different canopy chemical and structural properties, are important for predicting growth rates. We found that a linear combination of narrowband indices and elevation is correlated with standardized growth rates across all 20 tree species (R2~=~53.70\%). Although wavelengths from the entire visible-to-shortwave infrared spectrum were involved in our analysis, results point to relatively greater importance of visible and near-infrared regions for relating canopy reflectance to tree growth data. Overall, we demonstrate the potential for hyperspectral data to quantify tree demography over a much larger area than possible with field-based methods in forest inventory plots.},

However, the concept of change embodied in much of the traditional remote-sensing literature was primarily limited to capturing large or extreme changes occurring in natural systems, omitting many more subtle processes of interest to ecologists. Recent technical advances have led to a fundamental shift toward an ecological view of change. Although this conceptual shift began with coarser-scale global imagery, it has now reached users of Landsat imagery, since these datasets have temporal and spatial characteristics appropriate to many ecological questions. We argue that this ecologically relevant perspective of change allows the novel characterization of important dynamic processes, including disturbances, long-term trends, cyclical functions, and feedbacks, and that these improvements are already facilitating our understanding of critical driving forces, such as climate change, ecological interactions, and economic pressures.},

  abstract = {The survival of riparian forests depends on water input from their adjacent rivers. There are multiple, additional demands on river water that threatens to reduce the water supply, prompting the question, how much water must be left flowing within a river to sustain the native riparian ecosystems? To address this, we made eddy covariance measurements of riparian cottonwood forest evapotranspiration (ET) in a representative site and used remote sensing and the Penman-Monteith equation to up-scale ET along the 171 km river corridor from the Oldman River Dam to Lethbridge, Alberta. Our study was conducted in two growing seasons with contrasting weather conditions, including one with over-bank flooding (2014). Measured cumulative forest ET from May-September (2014: 451 $\pm$ 90 mm; 2015: 411 $\pm$ 18 mm) was very similar in the two years despite contrasting May-September cumulative precipitation input (2014: 362 mm; 2015: 181 mm). Integrated over the 56 km2 area of riparian forest along the Oldman River corridor, the cumulative forest ET during May-September was 19.1 million m3 (339 mm/season), about 0.9\% of the average cumulative Oldman River discharge during 2008\textendash{}2013. Cottonwood forest ET during May-June was less than 1\% of average river flow rates during 2008\textendash{}2013, but the ratio of ET to average river flow rate increased markedly to peak values of 4\textendash{}5\% in late July and early August. Our analysis indicated that the water-use rates of riparian cottonwood forests were high, even for a broad-leaf deciduous forest functional type, particularly given the modest leaf area index (1.4 m2 m-2) we measured for riparian forests along the Oldman River corridor. The high ET rates were possible because of tree access to alluvial groundwater to support transpiration. Our ET measurements and calculations provided perspective on riparian forest water use in relation to precipitation inputs and total river discharge, knowledge that is important for successfully managing the multiple demands on river water use.},

  abstract = {Accurate modelling of leaf chlorophyll content over a range of spatial and temporal scales is central to monitoring vegetation stress and physiological condition, and vegetation response to different ecological, climatic and anthropogenic drivers. A process-based modelling approach can account for variation in other factors affecting canopy reflectance, providing a more accurate estimate of chlorophyll content across different vegetation species, time-frames, and broader spatial extents. However, physically-based modelling studies usually use hyperspectral data, neglecting a wealth of data from broadband and multispectral sources. In this study, we assessed the potential for using canopy (4-Scale) and leaf radiative transfer (PROSPECT4/5) models to estimate leaf chlorophyll content using canopy Landsat satellite data and simulated Landsat bands from leaf level hyperspectral reflectance data. Over 600 leaf samples were used to test the performance of PROSPECT for different vegetation species, including black spruce (Picea mariana), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) and jack pine (Pinus banksiana). At the leaf level, hyperspectral and simulated Landsat bands showed very similar results to laboratory measured chlorophyll (R2 = 0.77 and R2 = 0.75, respectively). Comparisons between PROSPECT4 modelled chlorophyll from simulated Landsat and hyperspectral spectra showed a very close correspondence (R2 = 0.97, root mean square error (RMSE) = 3.01 $\mu$g/cm2), as did simulated reflectance bands from other broadband and narrowband sensors (MODIS: R2 = 0.99, RMSE = 1.80 $\mu$g/cm2; MERIS: R2 = 0.97, RMSE = 2.50 $\mu$g/cm2 and SPOT5 HRG: R2 = 0.96, RMSE = 5.38 $\mu$g/cm2). Modelled leaf chlorophyll content from Landsat 5 TM canopy reflectance data, acquired from over 40 ground validation sites, demonstrated a strong relationship with measured leaf chlorophyll content (R2 = 0.78, RMSE = 8.73 $\mu$g/cm2, p \&lt; 0.001), and a high linearity with negligible systematic bias. Study results demonstrate the small number of input bands required for PROSPECT inversion and provide a theoretical and operational basis for the future retrieval of leaf chlorophyll content using broadband or multispectral sensors within a physically-based approach.},

Long-term observations of plant phenology have been used to track vegetation responses to climate variability but are often limited to particular species and locations and may not represent synoptic patterns. Satellite remote sensing is instead used for continental to global monitoring. Although numerous methods exist to extract phenological timing, in particular start-of-spring (SOS), from time series of reflectance data, a comprehensive intercomparison and interpretation of SOS methods has not been conducted. Here, we assess 10 SOS methods for North America between 1982 and 2006. The techniques include consistent inputs from the 8~km Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer NDVIg dataset, independent data for snow cover, soil thaw, lake ice dynamics, spring streamflow timing, over 16~000 individual measurements of ground-based phenology, and two temperature-driven models of spring phenology. Compared with an ensemble of the 10 SOS methods, we found that individual methods differed in average day-of-year estimates by $\pm$60 days and in standard deviation by $\pm$20 days. The ability of the satellite methods to retrieve SOS estimates was highest in northern latitudes and lowest in arid, tropical, and Mediterranean ecoregions. The ordinal rank of SOS methods varied geographically, as did the relationships between SOS estimates and the cryospheric/hydrologic metrics. Compared with ground observations, SOS estimates were more related to the first leaf and first flowers expanding phenological stages. We found no evidence for time trends in spring arrival from ground- or model-based data; using an ensemble estimate from two methods that were more closely related to ground observations than other methods, SOS trends could be detected for only 12\% of North America and were divided between trends towards both earlier and later spring.},

  abstract = {Plant height is an important trait for plant reproductive success. Plant height is often under pollinator-mediated selection, and has been shown to be correlated with various other traits. However, few studies have examined the evolutionary trajectory of plant height under selection and the pleiotropic effects of plant height evolution. We conducted a bi-directional artificial selection experiment on plant height with fast cycling Brassica rapa plants to estimate its heritability and genetic correlations and to reveal evolutionary responses to artificial selection on height and various correlated traits. With the divergent lines obtained through artificial selection, we subsequently conducted pollinator-choice assays and investigated resource limitation of fruit production. We found that plant height variation is strongly genetically controlled (with a realized heritability of 41\% to 59\%). Thus, plant height can evolve rapidly under phenotypic selection. In addition, we found remarkable pleiotropic effects in phenology, morphology, floral scent, color, nectar, and leaf glucosinolates. Most traits were increased in tall line plants, but flower size, UV reflection, and glucosinolates were decreased, indicating potential trade-offs. Pollinators preferred plants of the tall selection lines over the short selection lines in both greenhouse settings with bumblebees and field experiment with natural pollinators. We did not detect any differences in resource limitation between plants of the different selection lines. Overall, our study predicts that increased height should evolve under positive pollinator-mediated directional selection with potential trade-offs in floral signals and herbivore defense.

  abstract = {Plant phenology plays a significant role in regulating carbon sequestration period of terrestrial ecosystems. Remote sensing of land surface phenology (LSP), i.e., the start and the end of the growing season (SOS and EOS, respectively) in evergreen needleleaf forests is particularly challenging due to their limited seasonal variability in canopy greenness. Using 107 site-years of CO2 flux data at 14 evergreen needleleaf forest sites in North America, we developed a new model to estimate SOS and EOS based entirely on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. We found that the commonly used vegetation indices (VI), including the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), were not able to detect SOS and EOS in these forests. The MODIS land surface temperature (LST) showed better performance in the estimation of SOS than did a single VI. Interestingly, the variability of LST (i.e., the coefficient of variation, CV\_LST) was more useful than LST itself in detecting changes in forest LSP. Therefore, a new model using the product of VI and CV\_LST was developed and it significantly improved the representation of LSP with mean errors of 11.7 and 5.6 days for SOS and EOS, respectively. Further validation at five sites in the Long Term Ecological Research network (LTER) using camera data also indicated the applicability of the new approach. These results suggest that temperature variability plays a previously overlooked role in phenological modeling, and a combination of canopy greenness and temperature could be a useful way to enhance the estimation of evergreen needleleaf forest phenology of future ecosystem models.},

  doi = {10.1111/1365-2745.12211},
  abstract = {*
The leaf economics spectrum (LES) provides a useful framework for examining species strategies as shaped by their evolutionary history. However, that spectrum, as originally described, involved only two key resources (carbon and nutrients) and one of three economically important plant organs. Herein, I evaluate whether the economics spectrum idea can be broadly extended to water \textendash{} the third key resource \textendash{}stems, roots and entire plants and to individual, community and ecosystem scales. My overarching hypothesis is that strong selection along trait trade-off axes, in tandem with biophysical constraints, results in convergence for any taxon on a uniformly fast, medium or slow strategy (i.e. rates of resource acquisition and processing) for all organs and all resources.

*
Evidence for economic trait spectra exists for stems and roots as well as leaves, and for traits related to water as well as carbon and nutrients. These apply generally within and across scales (within and across communities, climate zones, biomes and lineages).

*
There are linkages across organs and coupling among resources, resulting in an integrated whole-plant economics spectrum. Species capable of moving water rapidly have low tissue density, short tissue life span and high rates of resource acquisition and flux at organ and individual scales. The reverse is true for species with the slow strategy. Different traits may be important in different conditions, but as being fast in one respect generally requires being fast in others, being fast or slow is a general feature of species.

*
Economic traits influence performance and fitness consistent with trait-based theory about underlying adaptive mechanisms. Traits help explain differences in growth and survival across resource gradients and thus help explain the distribution of species and the assembly of communities across light, water and nutrient gradients.

  abstract = {In big-leaf models of canopy photosynthesis, the Rubisco activity per unit ground area is taken as the sum of activities per unit leaf area within the canopy, and electron transport capacity is similarly summed. Such models overestimate rates of photosynthesis and require empirical curvature factors in the response to irradiance. We show that, with any distribution of leaf nitrogen within the canopy (including optimal), the required curvature factors are not constant but vary with canopy leaf area index and leaf nitrogen content. We further show that the underlying reason is the difference between the time-averaged and instantaneous distributions of absorbed irradiance, caused by penetration of sunflecks and the range of leaf angles in canopies. These errors are avoided in models that treat the canopy in terms of a number of layers \textendash{} the multi-layer models. We present an alternative to the multi-layer model: by separately integrating the sunlit and shaded leaf fractions of the canopy, a single layered sun/shade model is obtained, which is as accurate and simpler. The model is a scaled version of a leaf model as distinct from an integrative approach.},

Synthesis of $\alpha$- and $\beta$-subunits of CF1 ATP-synthase complex with Mr of 55 and 53.5 kD also slightly increased in the tolerant Barakatli 95 and decreased in the drought sensitive variety Garagylchyg 2. A decrease in the intensity of 30 kD band and a significant increase were found in the content of the 25\textendash{}16 kD region in Garagylchyg 2 variety. The synthesis of 60 kD and content of low molecular mass polypeptides (21.5 and 12 kD) were increased in the tolerant genotype Barakatli 95. The intensity of peaks at 687, 695, and 742 nm considerably increases in the fluorescence spectra (77 K) of chloroplasts isolated from the sensitive variety Garagylchyg 2, and there is a stimulation of the ratio of fluorescence band intensity F687/F740. At the same time, higher level of glycine betaine was found in the drought tolerant variety compared with the control one throughout the different periods of growth.},

This review provides insight into the initial discovery of this pathway, the clues which led Hatch and Slack and others to these definitive experiments, some of the intrigue which surrounds the international activities which led up to the discovery, and personal insights into the future of this research field. While the biochemical understanding of the basic pathways came quickly, the role of the bundle sheath intermediate CO2 pool was not understood for a number of years, and the nature of C4 as a biochemical CO2 pump then linked the unique Kranz anatomy of C4 plants to their biochemical specialization. Decades of ``grind and find biochemistry'' and leaf physiology fleshed out the regulation of the pathway and the differences in physiological response to the environment between C3 and C4 plants. The more recent advent of plant transformation then high-throughput RNA and DNA sequencing and synthetic biology has allowed us both to carry out biochemical experiments and test hypotheses in planta and to better understand the evolution-driven molecular and genetic changes which occurred in the genomes of plants in the transition from C3 to C4. Now we are using this knowledge in attempts to engineer C4 rice and improve the C4 engine itself for enhanced food security and to provide novel biofuel feedstocks. The next 50 years of photosynthesis will no doubt be challenging, stimulating, and a drawcard for the best young minds in plant biology.},

  abstract = {Leaf pigment content can provide valuable insight into the physiological performance of leaves. Measurement of spectral reflectance provides a fast, nondestructive method for pigment estimation. A large number of spectral indices have been developed for estimation of leaf pigment content. However, in most cases these indices have been tested for only one or at most a few related species and thus it is not clear whether they can be applied across species with varying leaf structural characteristics. Our objective in this study was to develop spectral indices for prediction of leaf pigment content that are relatively insensitive to species and leaf structure variation and thus could be applied in larger scale remote-sensing studies without extensive calibration. We also quantified the degree of spectral interference between pigments when multiple pigments occur within the same leaf tissue. We found that previously published spectral indices provided relatively poor correlations with leaf chlorophyll content when applied across a wide range of species and plant functional types. Leaf surface reflectance appeared to be the most important factor in this variation. By developing a new spectral index that reduces the effect of differences in leaf surface reflectance, we were able to significantly improve the correlations with chlorophyll content. We also found that an index based on the first derivative of reflectance in the red edge region was insensitive to leaf structural variation. The presence of other pigments did not significantly affect estimation of chlorophyll from spectral reflectance. Previously published carotenoid and anthocyanin indices performed poorly across the whole data set. However, we found that the photochemical reflectance index (PRI, originally developed for estimation of xanthophyll cycle pigment changes) was related to carotenoid/chlorophyll ratios in green leaves. This result has important implications for the interpretation of PRI measured at both large and small scales. Our results demonstrate that spectral indices can be applied across species with widely varying leaf structure without the necessity for extensive calibration for each species. This opens up new possibilities for assessment of vegetation health in heterogeneous natural environments.},

  abstract = {SummarySince the discovery of mycorrhizal symbiosis 100 years ago, its role in the nitrogen metabolism of plants has received much attention. In early literature there are numerous reports of the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen by mycorrhizal fungi. N-fixation has been suggested in most kinds of mycorrhizal systems, i.e. ectomycorrhizal forest trees, orchids, Ericales, and VA-mycorrhizal plants. Today, however, it is generally accepted that only procaryotic organisms can fix atmospheric nitrogen and that both ecto- and endomycorrhizal fungi lack this capacity. Many vascular plants possess both mycorrhizae and N-fixing symbiotic organs. This group includes legumes with rhizobial nodules and non-legumes with actinorrhizal nodules. Mycorrhizae of such systems can be either ectotrophic or endotrophic, or both. Nitrogen fixation in forests and other natural ecosystems has recently been attributed mainly to associative-symbiotic bacteria, i.e. bacteria living in the rhizosphere or close proximity of plant roots. Since the roots, in fact, are usually also infected by mycorrhizal fungi, a new concept of mycorrhizosphere has been introduced. Relationships between mycorrhizal fungi and N-fixing bacteria of the mycorrhizosphere are poorly known. N-fixing bacteria have been found even inside the fungal mantle of ectomycorrhizae.},

  abstract = {Life on Earth depends on photosynthesis. Photosynthetic systems evolved early in Earth history, providing evidence for the significance of pigments in plant functions. Photosynthetic pigments fill multiple roles from increasing the range of energy captured for photosynthesis to protective functions. Given the importance of pigments to plant functioning, greater effort is needed to determine and quantify the relationship between gross primary production (GPP) and canopy chlorophyll (Chl) content, the main photosynthetic pigment, as well as its proxy, green leaf area index (GLAI), both used as quantitative measures of plant greenness. The objective of this study is to establish relationships for GPP vs. canopy Chl content and GPP vs. GLAI in maize. The main focus of the paper is to reveal fine details of the relationships and understand their features in different stages of maize development. Data on GPP, leaf Chl content and GLAI were collected across ten years (2001\textendash{}2010) at three AmeriFlux sites in Nebraska over irrigated and rainfed maize. Relationships of GPP vs. total canopy Chl content and GPP vs. GLAI were established for vegetative, tasseling and reproductive stages. In each stage, relationships were close with determination coefficients above 0.9; however, the shapes and slopes of the relationships in vegetative stages were different from reproductive stages. This difference was more pronounced for the GPP vs. GLAI relationship. In part, this difference is due to different leaf Chl contents in vegetative and reproductive stages. Smaller but detectable differences in shape and slope were also found for the GPP vs. canopy Chl relationship. Despite the differences in relationships for vegetative and reproductive stages, for the entire growing season, green LAI (GLAI) explained 90\% of GPP variation with a coefficient of variation (CV) = 17\%, while total canopy Chl content explained more than 92\% of GPP variation with CV = 15\%. Quantitative characterization of relationships between GPP and such biophysical characteristics as GLAI and canopy Chl content underlines the role of chlorophyll in photosynthesis and has significant implications on remote sensing of primary production.},

We hypothesized that through a shift in the vegetation community from palatable, deciduous dwarf shrubs to unpalatable, evergreen dwarf shrubs, selective herbivory may counteract the increased shrub abundance that is otherwise found in tundra ecosystems, in turn interacting with the responses of ecosystem carbon (C) stocks and CO2 balance to climatic warming. We tested this hypothesis in a 19-year field experiment with factorial treatments of warming and simulated herbivory on the dominant deciduous dwarf shrub Vaccinium~myrtillus. Warming was associated with a significantly increased vegetation abundance, with the strongest effect on deciduous dwarf shrubs, resulting in greater rates of both gross ecosystem production (GEP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) as well as increased C stocks. Simulated herbivory increased the abundance of evergreen dwarf shrubs, most importantly Empetrum nigrum ssp. hermaphroditum, which led to a recent shift in the dominant vegetation from deciduous to evergreen dwarf shrubs. Simulated herbivory caused no effect on GEP and ER or the total ecosystem C stocks, indicating that the vegetation shift counteracted the herbivore-induced C loss from the system. A larger proportion of the total ecosystem C stock was found aboveground, rather than belowground, in plots treated with simulated herbivory. We conclude that by providing a competitive advantage to unpalatable plant species with slow growth rates and long life spans, selective herbivory may promote aboveground C stocks in a warming tundra ecosystem and, through this mechanism, counteract C losses that result from plant biomass consumption.},

While a center of anomalous warm SST is observed in the eastern tropical Pacific in the case of the Eastern Pacific El Ni{\~n}o, it is located in the central tropical Pacific for the Central Pacific El Ni{\~n}o. We investigate the detailed SST response in the Kuroshio Extension region, where the anomalous SST is warm (cool) in the Central Pacific El Ni{\~n}o (Eastern Pacific El Ni{\~n}o) during the boreal fall and winter. We diagnose the SST tendency to identify the roles of the surface net heat fluxes and Ekman transport.

During the fall and winter, the atmospheric teleconnections over the North Pacific are quite different between the two types of El Ni{\~n}o, which might be due to changes in atmospheric diabatic forcing in relation to rainfall in the tropical Pacific. Our results suggest that the physical processes, which are responsible for the western North Pacific SST in response to the two different types of El Ni{\~n}o, are basically similar. That is, Ekman heat transport plays a key role in warming and cooling of the SST anomalies in the Kuroshio Extension region in the Central Pacific El Ni{\~n}o and Eastern Pacific El Ni{\~n}o, respectively. In contrast, the net surface heat fluxes act to weaken the SST anomalies. This result indicates that changes in the anomalous atmospheric circulation over the North Pacific, which is directly associated with Ekman currents at the upper levels, are important to determine the responses of SST in the Kuroshio Extension region to the two types of El Ni{\~n}o.},

We find that the average proposal takes 116 PI hours and 55 CI hours to write; although time spent writing was not related to whether the grant was funded. Effort did translate into success, however, as academics who wrote more grants received more funding. Participants indicated modest non-monetary benefits from grant writing, with psychologists reporting a somewhat greater benefit overall than astronomers. These perceptions of non-financial benefits were unrelated to how many grants investigators applied for, the number of grants they received, or the amount of time they devoted to writing their proposals. We also explored the number of years an investigator can afford to apply unsuccessfully for research grants and our analyses suggest that funding rates below approximately 20\%, commensurate with current NIH and NSF funding, are likely to drive at least half of the active researchers away from federally funded research.

However, a comprehensive analysis of the direct impacts of trait variation on global vegetation distribution does not yet exist. Here, we present such analysis as proof of principle. We run regressions of trait observations for leaf mass per area, stem-specific density, and seed mass from a global database against multiple environmental drivers, making use of findings of global trait convergence. This analysis explained up to 52\% of the global variation of traits. Global trait maps, generated by coupling the regression equations to gridded soil and climate maps, showed up to orders of magnitude variation in trait values. Subsequently, nine vegetation types were characterized by the trait combinations that they possess using Gaussian mixture density functions. The trait maps were input to these functions to determine global occurrence probabilities for each vegetation type. We prepared vegetation maps, assuming that the most probable (and thus, most suited) vegetation type at each location will be realized. This fully traits-based vegetation map predicted 42\% of the observed vegetation distribution correctly. Our results indicate that a major proportion of the predictive ability of DGVMs with respect to vegetation distribution can be attained by three traits alone if traits like stem-specific density and seed mass are included. We envision that our traits-based approach, our observation-driven trait maps, and our vegetation maps may inspire a new generation of powerful traits-based DGVMs.},

  abstract = {The responsiveness of 3 landrace (open-pollinated) sorghum cultivars and 3 modern (commercial) hybrids to arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and commercial fertilizers were assessed. Sorghum genotypes were selected to represent a range of sorghum breeding development. This comparison was conducted to link grain production and quality with crop nutrition strategies (AM symbiosis versus fertility amendments). The open-pollinated cultivars produced an average of 206\% more vegetative biomass and 285\% more grain per plant, compared to commercial hybrids when grown with AM fungi and no fertilization. Furthermore, the average protein production of open-pollinated cultivars was 320\% greater, compared to hybrids grown under the same low-fertility conditions. Percent AM root colonization was 149\% greater in open-pollinated cultivars compared to hybrids, and across all genotypes, AM colonization was significantly correlated with total grain mineral content. Sorghum cultivars were significantly more responsive to mycorrhizal symbiosis than commercial hybrids for nutrient uptake and subsequent grain production and quality, while hybrids were significantly more responsive to fertilization.},

The Mediterranean-type climate of California is characterized by a protracted summer drought, with precipitation occurring mainly from October through May. While drought stress increased continuously over both summer growing seasons, 1998 was wetter and cooler than average due to El Ni{\~n}o climate patterns and 1997 was hotter and drier than average. One extreme 3-day heat wave in 1997 (Days 218\textendash{}221) caused a step change in the relationship between H2O flux and vapor pressure deficit, resulting in a change in canopy conductance, possibly due to cavitation of the tree xylem. This step change was also correlated with decreased rates of C sequestration and evapotranspiration; we estimate that this extreme climatic event decreased gross ecosystem production (GEP) by roughly 20\% (4 $\mu$mol C m-2 s-1) for the rest of the growing season. In contrast, a cooler, wetter spring in 1998 delayed the onset of photosynthesis by about 3 weeks, resulting in roughly 20\% lower GEP relative to the spring of 1997. We conclude that the net C balance of Mediterranean-climate pine ecosystems is sensitive to extreme events under low soil moisture conditions and could be altered by slight changes in the climate or hydrologic regime.},

In contrast, considerable uncertainty persists surrounding regional contributions to the net global flux as well as the impacts of atmospheric and biological processes that drive the net flux. These uncertainties severely limit our ability to make confident predictions of future terrestrial biological carbon fluxes. Here we use a simple light-use efficiency land surface model (the Vegetation Photosynthesis Respiration Model, VPRM) driven by remotely sensed temperature, moisture, and phenology to diagnose North American gross ecosystem exchange (GEE), ecosystem respiration, and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) for the period 2001 to 2006. We optimize VPRM parameters to eddy covariance (EC) NEE observations from 65 North American FluxNet sites. We use a separate set of 27 cross-validation FluxNet sites to evaluate a range of spatial and temporal resolutions for parameter estimation. With these results we demonstrate that different spatial and temporal groupings of EC sites for parameter estimation achieve similar sum of squared residuals values through radically different spatial patterns of NEE. We also derive a regression model to estimate observed VPRM errors as a function of VPRM NEE, temperature, and precipitation. Because this estimate is based on model-observation residuals it is comprehensive of all the error sources present in modeled fluxes. We find that 1 km interannual variability in VPRM NEE is of similar magnitude to estimated 1 km VPRM NEE errors.},

The source of such variations has yet to be rigorously established\textemdash{}but the question of their impact on climate can be investigated. Here we report on a set of multimodel experiments to examine the impact of patterns of warming in the North Atlantic, and cooling in the South Atlantic, derived from observations, that is characteristic of the positive phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). The experiments were carried out with six atmospheric General Circulation Models (including two versions of one model), and a major goal was to assess the extent to which key climate impacts are consistent between the different models. The major climate impacts are found over North and South America, with the strongest impacts over land found over the United States and northern parts of South America. These responses appear to be driven by a combination of an off-equatorial Gill response to diabatic heating over the Caribbean due to increased rainfall within the region and a Northward shift in the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) due to the anomalous cross-equatorial SST gradient. The majority of the models show warmer US land temperatures and reduced Mean Sea Level Pressure during summer (JJA) in response to a warmer North Atlantic and a cooler South Atlantic, in line with observations. However the majority of models show no significant impact on US rainfall during summer. Over northern South America, all models show reduced rainfall in southern hemisphere winter (JJA), whilst in Summer (DJF) there is a generally an increase in rainfall. However, there is a large spread amongst the models in the magnitude of the rainfall anomalies over land. Away from the Americas, there are no consistent significant modelled responses. In particular there are no significant changes in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) over the North Atlantic and Europe in Winter (DJF). Additionally, the observed Sahel drying signal in African rainfall is not seen in the modelled responses. Suggesting that, in contrast to some studies, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation was not the primary driver of recent reductions in Sahel rainfall.},

  abstract = {Comparative studies on plant species have not distinguished between two inherently different applications of the idea of a trade-off. In the first case, the theoretical trade-off between two variables leads to a trend line, about which there is a degree of scatter. Any two species in the study are expected, in theory, to show a true trade-off, i.e. feature A must decrease for feature B to increase. This I call the `trend line' type of plot. In the second case, the species are expected to fill a considerable part of the space defined by two axes and the theoretical trade-off leads to a boundary line which limits the extent of the cloud of points. In this case, many interspecific comparisons are not expected to show evidence of a trade-off, but those on the boundary line are expected to do so. This I call the `boundary line' type of plot. In both types of plot, species within a given clade may show a true trade-off, while large numbers of unrelated species do not.First, I undertake to show, by means of examples, the reality of the distinction made above, and to demonstrate that statistically significant and ecologically important negative correlations between features A and B in the `trend line' type of plot can be accompanied by huge variation from the trend line. Second, for plots of the `boundary line' type, I undertake to show that authors have not always tested sufficiently rigorously the constraint lines concerning combinations of supposedly incompatible tolerances, and have not allowed for the absence of certain combinations of unfavourable conditions in the field and consequent lack of selection pressure for the evolution of species with a combination of extreme tolerances.I review two examples of each kind of constrained evolution. First, I take the worldwide leaf economics spectrum and the negative correlation between growth rate in high light and survival rate in deep shade. Second, I review the supposed incompatibilities between shade tolerance and drought tolerance, and between waterlogging tolerance and drought tolerance.I conclude that the term `trade-off' is used too loosely. The common lack of true trade-offs has made possible the species richness of present-day vegetation. Also, small numbers of species have evolved combinations of tolerances that might seem improbable. Not enough research is being aimed at understanding the mechanistic basis of variation about trend lines, and the crossing of supposed boundary lines.},

Our examples include the 1988 Yellowstone fires, the 1938 New England hurricane, the 1985 Tionesta tornado, the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, and the 1993 Mississippi floods. The resulting landscape patterns are strongly controlled by interactions between the specific disturbance, the abiotic environment (especially topography), and the composition and structure of the vegetation at the time of the disturbance. The very different natures of these interactions yield distinctive temporal and spatial patterns and demand that ecologists increase their knowledge of the physical characteristics of disturbance processes. Floods and fires can occur over a long period, whereas volcanic eruptions and wind-driven events often last for no more than a few hours or days. Tornadoes and floods produce linear patterns with sharp edges, but fires, volcanic eruptions, and hurricanes can affect broader areas, often with gradual transitions of disturbance intensity. In all cases, the evidence suggests that LIDs produce enduring legacies of physical and biological structure that influence ecosystem processes for decades or centuries.},

The elemental composition of plants is of fundamental importance for plant physiology and biogeochemical cycling. Knowledge about how the pattern of multi-element variability is coordinated between above- and below-ground organs remains limited. Here, we quantify multi-element variability in the leaves and roots of terrestrial plants, in addition to trying to understand its taxonomic and environmental regulation at large scales.

Location

China.

Methods

Sixteen elements in the leaves and fine roots of 792 plant species across nine forests located along the north\textendash{}south transect of eastern China were measured. General linear mixed models were used to partition taxonomic and environmental variation. Canonical discriminant analyses were conducted to identify elements with the highest discriminatory power for different plant orders.

Results

Elemental composition differed significantly between the leaves and roots, with the roots containing higher concentrations of trace metal elements (aluminium, iron, sodium, zinc, copper, lead, nickel and cobalt). A coordinated pattern of multi-element variability and similar taxonomic regulation was observed between the leaves and roots of terrestrial plants. That is, elements with higher internal concentrations were less variable, with most of the variability being attributed to taxonomic effects rather than the environment.

Main conclusions

Taxonomic and environmental regulation differed for different elements. Compared with microelements, macroelements exhibited a narrow range of internal concentrations, less environmental control and stronger taxonomic conservatism. The coordinated pattern of multi-element variability and similar taxonomic effects in the leaves and roots implies that above- and below-ground ecological processes are tightly linked.},

  abstract = {In-season, spatially variable nitrogen (N) fertilizer applications in agricultural systems can help to maximize crop N use efficiency and minimize N losses via hydrological leaching, runoff, and atmospheric volatilization. N fertilizer management often relies upon measurements of crop spectral reflectance using ground-based optical on-the-go sensors or hand-held chlorophyll meters. However, soil background reflectance can confound on-the-go sensing, especially during early crop growth stages, and hand-held chlorophyll meters are impractical for spatially explicit mapping at the field scale. Scanning laser technology is available that measures the intensity of the reflected laser light plus height information within a mm-scale ground instantaneous field of view at a very high sampling rate (up to 50,000 points s-1 in this study). We examined the ability to quantify foliar N status of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) using a green (532 nm) terrestrial laser scanner during an early stem extension growth stage (Zadoks growth stage 3.2). Laser data were processed by (1) removing soil background returns based on laser-determined height information, (2) standardizing green laser intensity based on white-reference panel readings, and (3) filtering noisy laser returns from leaf edges based on a laser return intensity threshold value. The return intensity of the reflected green laser light more accurately (r2 = 0.68, RMSE = 0.30 $\mu$g g-1) predicted foliar N concentration than conventional chlorophyll meter readings (r2 = 0.36, RMSE = 0.41 $\mu$g g-1) and spectral indices measured by a ground optical on-the-go sensor (r2 \&lt; 0.41, RMSE \&gt; 0.39 $\mu$g g-1). The results indicate that laser scanners are useful for measuring the N status of wheat during early growth stages, and provide justification for incorporating laser scanner based measurements into developing spatially-explicit estimates of foliar N during this critical growth period. Further research is needed to evaluate the operational practicality of a green scanning laser from a moving platform.},

  abstract = {Precipitation over the contiguous United States exhibits large multi-decadal oscillations since the early twentieth century, and they often lead to dry (e.g., 1946\textendash{}1976 and 1999-present) and wet (e.g., 1977\textendash{}1998) periods and apparent precipitation trends (e.g., from the 1950s to 1990s) over most of the western and central US. The exact cause of these inter-decadal variations is not fully understood. Using observational and reanalysis data and model simulations, this paper examines the influence of the Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) on US precipitation. The IPO is a leading mode of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) seen mostly in the Pacific Ocean. It is found that decadal precipitation variations over much of the West and Central US, especially the Southwest, closely follow the evolution of the IPO (r = 0.85 during 1923\textendash{}2010 for the Southwest US), and the dry and wet periods are associated, respectively, with the cold and warm phases of the IPO. In particular, the apparent upward trend from the 1950s\textendash{}1990s and the dry decade thereafter in precipitation over much of the West and Central US are largely caused by the IPO cycles, which switched to a warm phase around 1977 and back to a cold phase around 1999. An atmospheric model forced with observed SSTs reproduces much of this association of US precipitation with the IPO (r = 0.95 between smoothed observed and simulated Southwest US precipitation during 1950\textendash{}2009 and r = 0.88 between the simulated Southwest US precipitation and the IPO). Atmospheric reanalysis and model data both show a strong high (low) pressure center and anti-cyclonic (cyclonic) anomaly circulation over the North Pacific in the lower troposphere during cold (warm) phases of the IPO, which lead to dry and cold northwesterly and northerly winds and below-normal precipitation over much of the West US during IPO cold periods. The IPO induced changes are most pronounced during the boreal cold season. The results reinforce the notion that tropical Pacific SSTs (and the accompanying SST anomalies in the North Pacific) have large impacts on US precipitation and highlight the need to understand and simulate the IPO for decadal prediction of US precipitation.},

Continuous monitoring of plant functional traits dynamics on a large spatial scale is important to understand the mechanisms of ecosystem function degradation, especially on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. In this study, we investigated spatiotemporal trends of functional traits (i.e., chlorophyll content, leaf area index proxy of leaf size) in the eastern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau based on the combined analysis of multi-sensor satellite data and field observations at three spatial scales (ground-truth data at 1 m, Landsat at 30 m, MODIS at 500 m). Chlorophyll content was retrieved based on 94 field plots measurements. LAI was analyzed using MCD15A3H product and estimated values using digital hemispherical photographs in the field. The results show that field estimated LAI has better consistency with MCD15A3H product of main algorithm (QC$<$;64). The chlorophyll has significant positive linear trend in 15 years (2001-2015) and has strong increasing trend in the low area, which is correspond to the high chlorophyll content spatial heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {This report assesses past and prospective carbon stocks for 4.5 million ha of forest land in northern Wisconsin, including a baseline assessment and analysis of the impacts of disturbance and management on carbon stocks. Carbon density (amount of carbon stock per unit area) averages 237 megagrams (Mg) per ha, with the National Forest lands having slightly higher carbon density than other ownership classes. Over the last decade, carbon stocks of northern Wisconsin forests have been increasing by about one teragram (Tg) per year or 0.22 megagrams per ha per year, with most of the increase in live biomass. Harvest, wind, and fire have been principal drivers of forest carbon dynamics over the last century. For all forest types in northern Wisconsin, there is potential to increase stocking on the land by allowing more of the forested area to reach older age classes or by increasing productivity. Opportunities to increase afforestation and reduce deforestation are limited, but the potential exists for utilizing biomass energy as a substitute for fossil fuels. There are several options for private landowners to participate in carbon markets or greenhouse gas registries and receive some credit for additional actions to reduce emissions or increase sequestration of carbon.

Requirements are identified for more extensive intercomparisons of different approaches and for further work on the strategies for interpreting canopy scale data. The paper examines the prospects for extending research to the wider range of pigments in addition to chlorophyll, testing emerging methods of hyperspectral analysis and exploring the fusion of hyperspectral and LIDAR remote sensing. In spite of these opportunities for further development and the refinement of techniques, current evidence of an expanding range of applications in the ecophysiological, environmental, agricultural, and forestry sciences highlights the growing value of hyperspectral remote sensing of plant pigments.},

The significance of laser return intensity has been widely verified in airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR)-based forest canopy mapping, but this does not mean that all of its roles have been played. People still ask such questions as ``Is it possible using this optical attribute of lasers to investigate individual tree-crown insides wherein laser intensity data are typically yielded in complicated echo-triggering modes?'' To answer this question, this study examined the characteristics of the intensities of the laser points within 10 Quercus robur trees by fitting their peak amplitudes into default Gaussian distributions and then analyzing the resulting asymmetric tails. Exploratory data analyses showed that the laser points lying within the distribution tails can indicate primary tree branches in a sketchy way. This suggests that the question can be positively answered, and the traditional restriction of airborne LiDAR in canopy mapping at the crown level has been broken. Overall, this study found a unique way to detect primary tree branches in airborne LiDAR data and pointed out how to explore more ways this optical intensity attribute of airborne LiDAR data can measure tree organs at fine scales and further learn their properties.},

  abstract = {Experimental investigations of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) directly manipulate diversity then monitor ecosystem response to the manipulation. While these studies have generally confirmed the importance of biodiversity to the functioning of ecosystems, their broader significance has been difficult to interpret. The main reasons for this difficulty concern the small scales of the experiment, a bias towards plants and grasslands, and most importantly a general lack of clarity in terms of what attributes of functional diversity (FD) were actually manipulated. We review how functional traits, functional groups, and the relationship between functional and taxonomic diversity have been used in current BEF research. Several points emerged from our review. First, it is critical to distinguish between response and effect functional traits when quantifying or manipulating FD. Second, although it is widely done, using trophic position as a functional group designator does not fit the effect-response trait division needed in BEF research. Third, determining a general relationship between taxonomic and FD is neither necessary nor desirable in BEF research. Fourth, fundamental principles in community and biogeographical ecology that have been largely ignored in BEF research could serve to dramatically improve the scope and predictive capabilities of BEF research. We suggest that distinguishing between functional response traits and functional effect traits both in combinatorial manipulations of biodiversity and in descriptive studies of BEF could markedly improve the power of such studies. We construct a possible framework for predictive, broad-scale BEF research that requires integrating functional, community, biogeographical, and ecosystem ecology with taxonomy.},

  doi = {10.1111/1365-2745.12598},
  abstract = {Establishing trade-offs among traits and the degree to which they co-vary along environmental gradients has become a key focal point in the effort to develop community ecology into a predictive science. While there is evidence for these relationships across global datasets, they are often too broad in scale, and do not consider the particularities of local to regional species pools. This decreases their usefulness for developing predictive models at scales relevant for conservation and management. We tested for trade-offs between traits and relationships with environmental gradients in trees and shrubs sampled across southern African savannas and explored evidence for acquisitive vs. conservative resource use strategies using a phylogenetically explicit approach. We found a distinct trade-off between two major poles of specialization indicative of acquisitive (high leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC), leaf phosphorus concentration (LPC), leaf N:P, specific leaf area (SLA) and average leaf area (ALA)) and conservative resource use strategies (high leaf carbon to nitrogen ratios (C:N), tensile strength (TS) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC)). Although we found that trait variance and species occurrence were constrained by phylogeny, phylogenetically informed analyses did not contradict non-phylogenetic analyses, strengthening relationships in most cases. The high intra-site trait variability and weak relationships with soils and climate may in part be explained by the high levels of deciduousness and disturbance (i.e. fire and herbivory) inherent in African savannas. Synthesis: The relationships between traits and between traits and environmental gradients were far weaker than, and often contradictory to, broad scale studies that compare these relationships across biomes and growth forms, cautioning against making generalizations about relationships at specific sites based on broad scale analyses.

Here, we briefly review the uses of data on vegetation structure in ecosystem models, develop and analyze theoretical models to quantify model-data requirements, and describe recent progress using a mechanistic modeling approach utilizing a formal scaling method and data on vegetation structure to improve model predictions. Generally, both limited sampling and coarse resolution averaging lead to model initialization error, which in turn is propagated in subsequent model prediction uncertainty and error. In cases with representative sampling, sufficient resolution, and linear dynamics, errors in initialization tend to compensate at larger spatial scales. However, with inadequate sampling, overly coarse resolution data or models, and nonlinear dynamics, errors in initialization lead to prediction error. A robust model-data framework will require both models and data on vegetation structure sufficient to resolve important environmental gradients and tree-level heterogeneity in forest structure globally.},

Remote sensing (RS) offers a unique possibility to investigate GPP in a spatially explicit fashion; however, budgeting of terrestrial carbon cycles based on this approach still remains uncertain. To improve calculations, spatio-temporal variability of GPP must be investigated in more detail on local and regional scales. The overarching goal of this study is to enhance our knowledge on how environmentally induced changes of photosynthetic light-use efficiency (LUE) are linked with optical RS parameters. Diurnal courses of sun-induced fluorescence yield (FSyield) and the photochemical reflectance index of corn were derived from high-resolution spectrometric measurements and their potential as proxies for LUE was investigated. GPP was modeled using Monteith's LUE-concept and optical-based GPP and LUE values were compared with synoptically acquired eddy covariance data. It is shown that the diurnal response of complex physiological regulation of photosynthesis can be tracked reliably with the sun-induced fluorescence. Considering structural and physiological effects, this research shows for the first time that including sun-induced fluorescence into modeling approaches improves their results in predicting diurnal courses of GPP. Our results support the hypothesis that air- or spaceborne quantification of sun-induced fluorescence yield may become a powerful tool to better understand spatio-temporal variations of fluorescence yield, photosynthetic efficiency and plant stress on a global scale.},

  abstract = {Characterizing the wide range of light availability and photosynthetic properties throughout a plant canopy is important for modeling the exchanges of carbon, water, and nutrients between the biosphere and the atmosphere. Such characterization could be especially important in one of the world's most rapidly changing biomes \textendash{} the Arctic tundra \textendash{} where further warming-induced increases in the size, abundance and complexity of small arctic shrubs are projected. An improved understanding of their canopy organization could provide insights into associated climate feedbacks since multifaceted interactions between 3D canopy structure, environmental conditions, leaf physiology, and light availability affect the potentials and limitations of vegetation carbon assimilation and storage. The aim of this study was to explore new methods to elucidate evidence for photosynthetic partitioning according to light availability within a short canopy (\&lt;1 m tall) of Salix pulchra exposed to near continuous sunlight at low solar angles in the Arctic tundra. Instantaneous photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) and daily integrated quantum flux density (Qint) were modeled from a ray-tracing algorithm for voxels (edge-length .01 m) within the canopy that were each assigned a physically based directional gap fraction (DGF) and extinction coefficient (k) from which each voxel's effective leaf area index (LAIe) was calculated. Voxel parameters for the ray-tracing model were derived from the x, y, and z locations of high spatial resolution (\&lt;1 mm) three-dimensional (3D) maps of shrub canopies from terrestrial LiDAR point clouds. Two LiDAR-derived light quantification variables \textendash{} modeled Qint and path-length (determined as the accumulated photon travel distance from the canopy-edge) were compared with two variables derived from traditional light quantification techniques \textendash{} ceptometer derived leaf-area index (LAI), and manually measured vertical canopy depth. Insignificant relationships were observed between traditional measurements of light environment (LAI and vertical canopy depth) and TLS derived measurements (Qint and path length), suggesting wide variability among these methods. When each of four light quantification variables were compared against leaf-level variables classically associated with photosynthetic partitioning (percent nitrogen (N\%), chlorophyll a to b ratio (Chl a/b), and photosynthetic capacity (Amax)), patterns suggesting photosynthetic partitioning emerged only when the LiDAR-derived 3D locations of the leaf samples were considered (Qint and path length). Statistically significant (p \&lt; 0.05) trends that follow the theoretical response of leaves to light availability were observed between all three photosynthetic variables and LiDAR-derived Qint (r = 0.31, 0.46, 0.49 for N\%, Chl a/b, and Amax, respectively), while 2 of 3 showed a statistically significant response to LiDAR derived path length. Only 1 of 3 photosynthetic variables showed a statistically significant response to manually measured canopy depth or ceptometer derived LAI. Results from this study suggest that LiDAR-based techniques for quantifying the 3D light environment of small shrubs exposed to low solar angles reveal patterns of photosynthetic partitioning that may otherwise be overlooked using more traditional techniques.},

We analyzed fossil coral reconstructions of ENSO spanning the past 7000 years from the Northern Line Islands, located in the center of action for ENSO. The corals document highly variable ENSO activity, with no evidence for a systematic trend in ENSO variance, which is contrary to some models that exhibit a response to insolation forcing over this same period. Twentieth-century ENSO variance is significantly higher than average fossil coral ENSO variance but is not unprecedented. Our results suggest that forced changes in ENSO, whether natural or anthropogenic, may be difficult to detect against a background of large internal variability.
Coral records show that the El Ni{\~n}o\textendash{}Southern Oscillation may be less sensitive to past climate forcing than previously thought.

  abstract = {Timely and accurate monitoring of forest disturbance is essential to help us understand how the Earth system is changing. MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) imagery and subsequent MODIS products provide near-daily global coverage and have transformed the ways we study and monitor the Earth. To monitor forest disturbance, it is necessary to be able to compare observations of the same place from different times, but this is a challenging task using MODIS data as observations from different days have varying view angles and pixel sizes, and cover slightly different areas. In this paper, we propose a method to fuse MODIS and Landsat data in a way that allows for near real-time monitoring of forest disturbance. The method is based on using Landsat time-series images to predict the next MODIS image, which forms a stable basis for comparison with new MODIS acquisitions. The predicted MODIS images represent what the surface should look like assuming no disturbance, and the difference in the spectral signatures between predicted and observed MODIS images becomes the ``signal'' used for detecting forest disturbance. The method was able to detect subpixel forest disturbance with a producer's accuracy of 81\% and a user's accuracy of 90\%. Patches of forest disturbance as small as 5 to 7 ha in size were detected on a daily basis. The encouraging results indicate that the presented fusion method holds promise for improving monitoring of forest disturbance in near real-time.},

  abstract = {We assessed the potential for using optical functional types as effective markers to monitor changes in vegetation in floodplain meadows associated with changes in their local environment. Floodplain meadows are challenging ecosystems for monitoring and conservation because of their highly biodiverse nature. Our aim was to understand and explain spectral differences among key members of floodplain meadows and also characterize differences with respect to functional traits. The study was conducted on a typical floodplain meadow in UK (MG4-type, mesotrophic grassland type 4, according to British National Vegetation Classification). We compared two approaches to characterize floodplain communities using field spectroscopy. The first approach was sub-community based, in which we collected spectral signatures for species groupings indicating two distinct eco-hydrological conditions (dry and wet soil indicator species). The other approach was ``species-specific'', in which we focused on the spectral reflectance of three key species found on the meadow. One herb species is a typical member of the MG4 floodplain meadow community, while the other two species, sedge and rush, represent wetland vegetation. We also monitored vegetation biophysical and functional properties as well as soil nutrients and ground water levels. We found that the vegetation classes representing meadow sub-communities could not be spectrally distinguished from each other, whereas the individual herb species was found to have a distinctly different spectral signature from the sedge and rush species. The spectral differences between these three species could be explained by their observed differences in plant biophysical parameters, as corroborated through radiative transfer model simulations. These parameters, such as leaf area index, leaf dry matter content, leaf water content, and specific leaf area, along with other functional parameters, such as maximum carboxylation capacity and leaf nitrogen content, also helped explain the species' differences in functional dynamics. Groundwater level and soil nitrogen availability, which are important factors governing plant nutrient status, were also found to be significantly different for the herb/wetland species' locations. The study concludes that spectrally distinguishable species, typical for a highly biodiverse site such as a floodplain meadow, could potentially be used as target species to monitor vegetation dynamics under changing environmental conditions.},

A plant phylogeny was then used to map the mycorrhizal information to examine evolutionary patterns. Several findings from this survey enhance our understanding of the roles of mycorrhizas in the origin and subsequent diversification of land plants. First, 80 and 92\% of surveyed land plant species and families are mycorrhizal. Second, arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) is the predominant and ancestral type of mycorrhiza in land plants. Its occurrence in a vast majority of land plants and early-diverging lineages of liverworts suggests that the origin of AM probably coincided with the origin of land plants. Third, ectomycorrhiza (ECM) and its derived types independently evolved from AM many times through parallel evolution. Coevolution between plant and fungal partners in ECM and its derived types has probably contributed to diversification of both plant hosts and fungal symbionts. Fourth, mycoheterotrophy and loss of the mycorrhizal condition also evolved many times independently in land plants through parallel evolution.},

  abstract = {To answer new scientific and ecological questions and monitor multiple forest changes, a fine scale characterization of these ecosystems is needed, and could imply the mapping of specific species, of detailed forest types, and of functional composition. This characterization can be now provided by the novel Earth Observation tools. This study aims to contribute to understanding the innovation in forest and ecological research that can be brought in by advanced remote sensing instruments, and proposes the guild mapping approach as a tool to efficiently monitor the varied tropical forest resources. We evaluated, in tropical Ghanaian forests, the ability of airborne hyperspectral and simulated multispectral Sentinel-2 data, and derived vegetation indices and textures, to: distinguish between two different forest types; to discriminate among selected dominant species; and to separate trees species grouped according to their functional guilds: Pioneer, Non Pioneer Light Demanding, and Shade Bearer. We then produced guild classification maps for each area using hyperspectral data. Our results showed that with both hyperspectral and simulated Sentinel-2 data these discrimination tasks can be successfully accomplished. Results also stressed the importance of texture features, especially if using the lower spectral and spatial Sentinel-2 resolution data, and highlighted the important role of the new Sentinel-2 data for ecological monitoring. Classification results showed a statistically significant improvement in overall accuracy using Support Vector Machine, over Maximum Likelihood approach. We proposed the functional guilds mapping as an innovative approach to: (i) monitor compositional changes, especially with respect to the effects of global climate change on forests, and particularly in the tropical biome where the occurrence of hundreds of species prevents mapping activities at species level; (ii) support large-scale forest inventories. The imminent Sentinel-2 data could serve to open the road for the development of new concepts and methods in forestry and ecological research.},

  doi = {10.3390/rs8020133},
  abstract = {Semi-natural grasslands with grazing management are characterized by high fine-scale species richness and have a high conservation value. The fact that fine-scale surveys of grassland plant communities are time-consuming may limit the spatial extent of ground-based diversity surveys. Remote sensing tools have the potential to support field-based sampling and, if remote sensing data are able to identify grassland sites that are likely to support relatively higher or lower levels of species diversity, then field sampling efforts could be directed towards sites that are of potential conservation interest. In the present study, we examined whether aerial hyperspectral (414\textendash{}2501 nm) remote sensing can be used to predict fine-scale plant species diversity (characterized as species richness and Simpson's diversity) in dry grazed grasslands. Vascular plant species were recorded within 104 (4 m~\texttimes{}  4 m) plots on the island of {\"O}land (Sweden) and each plot was characterized by a 245-waveband hyperspectral data set. We used two different modeling approaches to evaluate the ability of the airborne spectral measurements to predict within-plot species diversity: (1) a spectral response approach, based on reflectance information from (i) all wavebands, and (ii) a subset of wavebands, analyzed with a partial least squares regression model, and (2) a spectral heterogeneity approach, based on the mean distance to the spectral centroid in an ordinary least squares regression model. Species diversity was successfully predicted by the spectral response approach (with an error of ca. 20\%) but not by the spectral heterogeneity approach. When using the spectral response approach, iterative selection of important wavebands for the prediction of the diversity measures simplified the model but did not improve its predictive quality (prediction error). Wavebands sensitive to plant pigment content (400\textendash{}700 nm) and to vegetation structural properties, such as above-ground biomass (700\textendash{}1300 nm), were identified as being the most important predictors of plant species diversity. We conclude that hyperspectral remote sensing technology is able to identify fine-scale variation in grassland diversity and has a potential use as a tool in surveys of grassland plant diversity.},

Current methods could benefit from a model-based probabilistic framework that accommodates covariance between traits and quantifies contributions from inherent trait syndromes, species interactions, and responses to the environment. I develop a model-based approach that separates these effects on trait diversity. Application to USDA Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data in the eastern United States demonstrates an apparent paradox, that the analysis of species better explains and predicts traits than does direct analysis of the traits themselves; trait data contain less, not more, information than species on environmental responses. Whereas variation in some traits is dominated by inherent syndromes (tendency for certain traits to be associated with others within an individual and species), others are strongly controlled by variation in species diversity. There is substantial variation in environmental control on trait patterns, between traits and regionally. In terms of environmental response traits do not aggregate into defined plant functional types, as would be desirable for models.},

Recently a new program (named Fmask) designed to accomplish these tasks was introduced for use with images from Landsats 4\textendash{}7 (Zhu \&amp; Woodcock, 2012). In this paper, there are the following: (1) improvements in the Fmask algorithm for Landsats 4\textendash{}7; (2) a new version for use with Landsat 8 that takes advantage of the new cirrus band; and (3) a prototype algorithm for Sentinel 2 images. Though Sentinel 2 images do not have a thermal band to help with cloud detection, the new cirrus band is found to be useful for detecting clouds, especially for thin cirrus clouds. By adding a new cirrus cloud probability and removing the steps that use the thermal band, the Sentinel 2 scenario achieves significantly better results than the Landsats 4\textendash{}7 scenario for all 7 images tested. For Landsat 8, almost all the Fmask algorithm components are the same as for Landsats 4\textendash{}7, except a new cirrus cloud probability is calculated using the new cirrus band, which improves detection of thin cirrus clouds. Landsat 8 results are better than the Sentinel 2 scenario, with 6 out of 7 test images showing higher accuracies.},

Growthform differences in chemical allocation occurred on a leaf mass and area basis. Light capture-growth and maintenance-metabolism chemicals averaged 14.5 and 16.7\% higher mass-based concentration in lianas than in trees globally, whereas structure and defence chemicals averaged 9.0\% lower in lianas. Relative differences in chemical allocation by lianas and trees were mediated by climate with peak differences at about 2500~mm~year-1 and 25~$^\circ$C. Differences in chemical traits suggest that liana expansion could be greatest in forests undergoing increased canopy-level irradiance via disturbance and climate change.},

Here I summarize the structure of HB and provide examples for common spatiotemporal problems. The flexible framework means that parameters, variables and latent variables can represent broader classes of model elements than are treated in traditional models. Inference and prediction depend on two types of stochasticity, including (1) uncertainty, which describes our knowledge of fixed quantities, it applies to all `unobservables' (latent variables and parameters), and it declines asymptotically with sample size, and (2) variability, which applies to fluctuations that are not explained by deterministic processes and does not decline asymptotically with sample size. Examples demonstrate how different sources of stochasticity impact inference and prediction and how allowance for stochastic influences can guide research.},

This seasonal cycle is timed to the seasonality of solar radiation in a manner that is suggestive of anticipatory and opportunistic patterns of net leaf flushing during the early to mid part of the light-rich dry season and net leaf abscission during the cloudy wet season. These seasonal swings in leaf area may be critical to initiation of the transition from dry to wet season, seasonal carbon balance between photosynthetic gains and respiratory losses, and litterfall nutrient cycling in moist tropical forests.},

Recent studies have found, however, that photoperiod is a better descriptor than temperature of the seasonal variability of photosynthetic physiology at the leaf scale. Incorporating photoperiodic control into global models consequently improves their representation of the seasonality and magnitude of atmospheric CO2 concentration. The role of photoperiod versus that of temperature in controlling the seasonal variability of photosynthetic function at the canopy scale remains unexplored. We quantified the seasonal variability of ecosystem-level light response curves using nearly 400 site years of eddy covariance data from over eighty Free Fair-Use sites in the FLUXNET database. Model parameters describing maximum canopy CO2 uptake and the initial slope of the light response curve peaked after peak temperature in about 2/3 of site years examined, emphasizing the important role of temperature in controlling seasonal photosynthetic function. Akaike's Information Criterion analyses indicated that photoperiod should be included in models of seasonal parameter variability in over 90 \% of the site years investigated here, demonstrating that photoperiod also plays an important role in controlling seasonal photosynthetic function. We also performed a Granger causality analysis on both gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) and GEP normalized by photosynthetic photon flux density (GEP n ). While photoperiod Granger-caused GEP and GEP n in 99 and 92 \% of all site years, respectively, air temperature Granger-caused GEP in a mere 32 \% of site years but Granger-caused GEP n in 81 \% of all site years. Results demonstrate that incorporating photoperiod may be a logical step toward improving models of ecosystem carbon uptake, but not at the expense of including enzyme kinetic-based temperature constraints on canopy-scale photosynthesis.},

  abstract = {Despite being recognized as a promoter of diversity and a condition for local coexistence decades ago, the importance of intraspecific variance has been neglected over time in community ecology. Recently, there has been a new emphasis on intraspecific variability. Indeed, recent developments in trait-based community ecology have underlined the need to integrate variation at both the intraspecific as well as interspecific level. We introduce new T-statistics (`T' for trait), based on the comparison of intraspecific and interspecific variances of functional traits across organizational levels, to operationally incorporate intraspecific variability into community ecology theory. We show that a focus on the distribution of traits at local and regional scales combined with original analytical tools can provide unique insights into the primary forces structuring communities.},

  abstract = {Human activities have greatly altered global carbon (C) and Nitrogen (N) cycling. In fact, atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) have increased 40\% over the last century and the amount of N cycling in the biosphere has more than doubled. In an effort to understand how plants will respond to continued global CO2 fertilization, long-term free-air CO2 enrichment experiments have been conducted at sites around the globe. Here we examine how atmospheric CO2 enrichment and N fertilization affects the uptake of silicon (Si) in the Duke Forest, North Carolina, a stand dominated by Pinus taeda (loblolly pine), and five hardwood species. Specifically, we measured foliar biogenic silica concentrations in five deciduous and one coniferous species across three treatments: CO2 enrichment, N enrichment, and N and CO2 enrichment. We found no consistent trends in foliar Si concentration under elevated CO2, N fertilization, or combined elevated CO2 and N fertilization. However, two-thirds of the tree species studied here have Si foliar concentrations greater than well-known Si accumulators, such as grasses. Based on net primary production values and aboveground Si concentrations in these trees, we calculated forest Si uptake rates under control and elevated CO2 concentrations. Due largely to increased primary production, elevated CO2 enhanced the magnitude of Si uptake between 20 and 26\%, likely intensifying the terrestrial silica pump. This uptake of Si by forests has important implications for Si export from terrestrial systems, with the potential to impact C sequestration and higher trophic levels in downstream ecosystems.},

However, accounting for these uncertainties is a difficult task, since ecology is known for its complexity. Measurement and/or process errors are often the only sources of uncertainty modeled when addressing complex ecological problems, yet analyses should also account for uncertainty in sampling design, in model specification, in parameters governing the specified model, and in initial and boundary conditions. Only then can we be confident in the scientific inferences and forecasts made from an analysis. Probability and statistics provide a framework that accounts for multiple sources of uncertainty. Given the complexities of ecological studies, the hierarchical statistical model is an invaluable tool. This approach is not new in ecology, and there are many examples (both Bayesian and non-Bayesian) in the literature illustrating the benefits of this approach. In this article, we provide a baseline for concepts, notation, and methods, from which discussion on hierarchical statistical modeling in ecology can proceed. We have also planted some seeds for discussion and tried to show where the practical difficulties lie. Our thesis is that hierarchical statistical modeling is a powerful way of approaching ecological analysis in the presence of inevitable but quantifiable uncertainties, even if practical issues sometimes require pragmatic compromises.},

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0152883},
  abstract = {Predictions from forest ecosystem models are limited in part by large uncertainties in the current state of the land surface, as previous disturbances have important and lasting influences on ecosystem structure and fluxes that can be difficult to detect. Likewise, future disturbances also present a challenge to prediction as their dynamics are episodic and complex and occur across a range of spatial and temporal scales. While large extreme events such as tropical cyclones, fires, or pest outbreaks can produce dramatic consequences, small fine-scale disturbance events are typically much more common and may be as or even more important. This study focuses on the impacts of these smaller disturbance events on the predictability of vegetation dynamics and carbon flux. Using data on vegetation structure collected for the same domain at two different times, i.e. ``repeat lidar data'', we test high-resolution model predictions of vegetation dynamics and carbon flux across a range of spatial scales at an important tropical forest site at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. We found that predicted height change from a height-structured ecosystem model compared well to lidar measured height change at the domain scale (\textasciitilde{}150 ha), but that the model-data mismatch increased exponentially as the spatial scale of evaluation decreased below 20 ha. We demonstrate that such scale-dependent errors can be attributed to errors predicting the pattern of fine-scale forest disturbances. The results of this study illustrate the strong impact fine-scale forest disturbances have on forest dynamics, ultimately limiting the spatial resolution of accurate model predictions.},

However, the majority of this work has been attempted without reference to the needs of ecological process studies. While model initialisation is an important task there are other ways in which remote sensing can be combined with ecological models. This paper identifies four alternative strategies: (i) to use remotely sensed data to provide estimates of variables required to drive ecological process models, (ii) to use remotely sensed data to test, validate or verify predictions of ecological process models, (iii) to use remotely sensed data to update or adjust ecological process model predictions and (iv) to use ecological process models to understand remotely sensed data. The objectives of the paper are to review the four strategies by reference to examples. Directions for future work are identified for each strategy, which can be grouped in terms of estimation accuracy, issues of spatial and temporal scale, long term comprehensive datasets and development of new methods and models with the emphasis on increased interaction between scientists from the remote sensing and ecological modelling disciplines.},

  abstract = {In the last 50 years intensification of agricultural land use systems drastically reduced extensively used grassland areas. These areas are of high ecological value due to high species richness and occurring rare species. Therefore, recent European Union (EU) laws stipulate the conservation and monitoring of this farmland, also called ``high nature value'' (HNV) farmland. As a consequence of these new laws, a so called HNV indicator system was implemented that requires all EU member states to establish a nationwide monitoring system for HNV areas. These monitoring systems are challenged among other by the difficult differentiation between grassland types which today at fine scale is only possible with time and cost intensive field work. Due to this high work-load and financial limitations, nationwide field campaigns have to be sample-based and hence will not deliver a spatially consistent result.

In this study, we examine whether low and high nature value grasslands can be differentiated with remotely-sensed reflectance data, which could support existing field survey-based monitoring approaches. We used multi-seasonal, multispectral remote sensing data (RapidEye) in combination with sparse field data (collected in southern Germany) and three one-class classifiers to classify A) HNV grassland against other areas and to differentiate between B) three quality classes of HNV grassland according to the current German HNV monitoring approach.

The results for A) indicated high performances of the tested approaches to identify HNV grassland areas. Biased support vector machine delivered best overall results (high detection rate and low false positive rates). However, the results also showed a consistent underestimation of HNV grasslands. Results for B) showed that a separation into several HNV quality classes is not possible with any of the tested approaches.

We conclude that with the presented approach HNV grasslands can be identified from the landscape matrix based on its spectral signal. Combining the presented approach with an object oriented classifier or with land registry data could further improve the results.},

  abstract = {Question:  A set of easily-measured (`soft') plant traits has been identified as potentially useful predictors of ecosystem functioning in previous studies. Here we aimed to discover whether the screening techniques remain operational in widely contrasted circumstances, to test for the existence of axes of variation in the particular sets of traits, and to test for their links with `harder' traits of proven importance to ecosystem functioning. Location:  central-western Argentina, central England, northern upland Iran, and north-eastern Spain. Recurrent patterns of ecological specialization:  Through ordination of a matrix of 640 vascular plant taxa by 12 standardized traits, we detected similar patterns of specialization in the four floras. The first PCA axis was identified as an axis of resource capture, usage and release. PCA axis 2 appeared to be a size-related axis. Individual PCA for each country showed that the same traits remained valuable as predictors of resource capture and utilization in all of them, despite their major differences in climate, biogeography and land-use. The results were not significantly driven by particular taxa: the main traits determining PCA axis 1 were very similar in eudicotyledons and monocotyledons and Asteraceae, Fabaceae and Poaceae. Links between recurrent suites of `soft' traits and `hard' traits:  The validity of PCA axis 1 as a key predictor of resource capture and utilization was tested by comparisons between this axis and values of more rigorously established predictors (`hard' traits) for the floras of Argentina and England. PCA axis 1 was correlated with variation in relative growth rate, leaf nitrogen content, and litter decomposition rate. It also coincided with palatability to model generalist herbivores. Therefore, location on PCA axis 1 can be linked to major ecosystem processes in those habitats where the plants are dominant. Conclusion:  We confirm the existence at the global scale of a major axis of evolutionary specialization, previously recognised in several local floras. This axis reflects a fundamental trade-off between rapid acquisition of resources and conservation of resources within well-protected tissues. These major trends of specialization were maintained across different environmental situations (including differences in the proximate causes of low productivity, i.e. drought or mineral nutrient deficiency). The trends were also consistent across floras and major phylogenetic groups, and were linked with traits directly relevant to ecosystem processes.},

We think that true comparability can hardly be achieved by using conventional vegetation classification approaches, which are not transferable if they take account of the individuality of areas. To reach such comparability, an approach would be needed that combines generality with flexibility to adapt to local conditions.

Therefore, we propose that the local vegetation is broken down into basic strategy types as proposed by Phil Grime in 1974. He observed general rules in the occurrence of three general plant strategies: competitive ability (C), stress tolerance (S), and ruderal strategy (R). Our research question is whether these strategy types can be used to derive functional signatures of landscapes as a basis for comparison between conservation areas.

We used the CSR concept to map plant strategies in a heath landscape based on remote sensing data. Average Grime CSR values of vegetation samples were regressed against airborne hyperspectral imagery, resulting in spatial representations of C, S, and R (val. r2 of 0.55, 0.59, and 0.28, respectively). Based on this continuous information we created functional signatures for two subareas of the study site, the `CSR-fingerprints'.

We found clear differences in the CSR signatures of different parts of the investigated area. We think that similar differences in time can also be assessed using the same approach. This could provide a simple but powerful expression of the state of vegetation that would be comparable across regions and time. We therefore assume that the method is suitable for comparative studies with a focus on vegetation functioning. While it does not explicitly take into account differences in species composition, it can also work as an early warning system with follow-up investigations in areas subjected to change.},

  abstract = {Process-based models (PBMs) of vegetation function can be used to interpret and integrate experimental results. Water limitation to plant carbon uptake is a highly uncertain process in the context of environmental change, and many experiments have been carried out that study drought limitations to vegetation function at spatial scales from seedlings to entire canopies. What is lacking in the synthesis of these experiments is a quantitative tool incorporating a detailed mechanistic representation of the water balance that can be used to integrate and analyse experimental results at scales of both the whole-plant and the forest canopy. To fill this gap, we developed an individual tree-based model (MAESPA), largely based on combining the well-known MAESTRA and SPA ecosystem models. The model includes a hydraulically-based model of stomatal conductance, root water uptake routines, drainage, infiltration, runoff and canopy interception, as well as detailed radiation interception and leaf physiology routines from the MAESTRA model. The model can be applied both to single plants of arbitrary size and shape, as well as stands of trees. The utility of this model is demonstrated by studying the interaction between elevated [CO2] (eCa) and drought. Based on theory, this interaction is generally expected to be positive, so that plants growing in eCa should be less susceptible to drought. Experimental results, however, are varied. We apply the model to a previously published experiment on droughted cherry, and show that changes in plant parameters due to long-term growth at eCa (acclimation) may strongly affect the outcome of Ca \texttimes{} drought experiments. We discuss potential applications of MAESPA and some of the key uncertainties in process representation.},

  abstract = {* Recent evidence suggests that soil nutrient heterogeneity, a ubiquitous feature of terrestrial ecosystems, modulates plant responses to ongoing global change (GC). However, we know little about the overall trends of such responses, the GC drivers involved and the plant attributes affected.

* We synthesized literature to answer the question: Does soil heterogeneity significantly affect plant responses to main GC drivers, such as elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (CO2), nitrogen (N) enrichment and changes in rainfall regime?

* Overall, most studies have addressed short-term effects of N enrichment on the performance of model plant communities using experiments conducted under controlled conditions. The role of soil heterogeneity as a modulator of plant responses to elevated CO2 may depend on the plasticity in nutrient uptake patterns. Soil heterogeneity does interact with N enrichment to determine plant growth and nutrient status, but the outcome of this interaction has been found to be both synergistic and inhibitory. The very few studies published on interactive effects of soil heterogeneity and changes in rainfall regime prevented us from identifying any general pattern.

* We identify the long-term consequences of soil heterogeneity on plant community dynamics in the field, and the ecosystem-level responses of the soil heterogeneity~\texttimes~GC driver interaction, as the main knowledge gaps in this area of research.

* To fill these gaps and take soil heterogeneity and GC research a step forward, we propose the following research guidelines: (i) combining morphological and physiological plant responses to soil heterogeneity with field observations of community composition and predictions from simulation models and (ii) incorporating soil heterogeneity into a trait-based response-effect framework, where plant-resource-use traits are used as both response variables to this heterogeneity and GC, and predictors of ecosystem functioning.

* Synthesis. There is enough evidence to affirm that soil heterogeneity modulates plant responses to elevated atmospheric CO2 and N enrichment. Our synthesis indicates that we must explicitly consider soil heterogeneity to accurately predict plant responses to GC drivers.},

Leaf samples were collected in the four seasons of the year to determine the content of macronutrients (N, K, P, Mg, Ca, S) and photosynthetic pigments (Chla, Chlb, Chltot, Cartot, Chla:Chlb and Cartot:Chltot). The principal component analysis showed that leaf pigments contributed to the formation of the first axis, which explains most of the data variance for all species, while leaf nutrient contribution showed strong interspecific variation. These results demonstrate that the studied species have different strategies for acquisition and use of mineral resources and acclimation to light, which are determinant for them to coexist in the forest environment.Key words: chlorophyll; Araucaria forest; Deciduous Forest; macronutrients},

  abstract = {Forests are major components of the global carbon cycle, providing substantial feedback to atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Our ability to understand and predict changes in the forest carbon cycle\textemdash{}particularly net primary productivity and carbon storage\textemdash{}increasingly relies on models that represent biological processes across several scales of biological organization, from tree leaves to forest stands. Yet, despite advances in our understanding of productivity at the scales of leaves and stands, no consensus exists about the nature of productivity at the scale of the individual tree, in part because we lack a broad empirical assessment of whether rates of absolute tree mass growth (and thus carbon accumulation) decrease, remain constant, or increase as trees increase in size and age. Here we present a global analysis of 403 tropical and temperate tree species, showing that for most species mass growth rate increases continuously with tree size. Thus, large, old trees do not act simply as senescent carbon reservoirs but actively fix large amounts of carbon compared to smaller trees; at the extreme, a single big tree can add the same amount of carbon to the forest within a year as is contained in an entire mid-sized tree. The apparent paradoxes of individual tree growth increasing with tree size despite declining leaf-level and stand-level productivity can be explained, respectively, by increases in a tree/'s total leaf area that outpace declines in productivity per unit of leaf area and, among other factors, age-related reductions in population density. Our results resolve conflicting assumptions about the nature of tree growth, inform efforts to undertand and model forest carbon dynamics, and have additional implications for theories of resource allocation and plant senescence.},

We evaluate if continuously updating canopy state variables with observations is beneficial for predicting phenological events. We employed ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF) to update predictions of leaf area index (LAI) and leaf extension using tower-based photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and moderate resolution imaging spectrometer (MODIS) data for 2002\textendash{}2005 at Willow Creek, Wisconsin, USA, a mature, even-aged, northern hardwood, deciduous forest. The ecosystem demography model version 2 (ED2) was used as the prediction model, forced by offline climate data. EAKF successfully incorporated information from both the observations and model predictions weighted by their respective uncertainties. The resulting estimate reproduced the observed leaf phenological cycle in the spring and the fall better than a parametric model prediction. These results indicate that during spring the observations contribute most in determining the correct bud-burst date, after which the model performs well, but accurately modeling fall leaf senesce requires continuous model updating from observations. While the predicted net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 precedes tower observations and unassimilated model predictions in the spring, overall the prediction follows observed NEE better than the model alone. Our results show state data assimilation successfully simulates the evolution of plant leaf phenology and improves model predictions of forest NEE.},

* The model performed well for independent Brazilian sunlit and shade canopy leaves (R2~=~0.75\textendash{}0.78), suggesting that canopy leaves (and their associated spectra) follow constrained developmental trajectories even in contrasting forests. The model did not perform as well for mid-canopy and understory leaves (R2~=~0.27\textendash{}0.29), because leaves in different environments have distinct traits and trait developmental trajectories.

Information on turnover of organic matter components, the role of microbial products, and modeling of SOM, and tracer research should help us to anticipate what future research may answer today's challenges. Our globe's most important natural resource is best studied relative to its chemistry, dynamics, matrix interactions, and microbial transformations. Humus has similar, worldwide characteristics, but varies with abiotic controls, soil type, vegetation inputs and composition, and the soil biota. It contains carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, phenol-aromatics, protein-derived and cyclic nitrogenous compounds, and some still unknown compounds. Protection of transformed plant residues and microbial products occurs through spatial inaccessibility-resource availability, aggregation of mineral and organic constituents, and interactions with sesquioxides, cations, silts, and clays. Tracers that became available in the mid-20th century made the study of SOM dynamics possible. Carbon dating identified resistant, often mineral-associated, materials to be thousands of years old, especially at depth in the profile. The 13C associated with C3C4 plant switches characterized slow turnover pools with ages ranging from dozens to hundreds of years. Added tracers, in conjunction with compound-specific product analysis and incubation, identified active pools with fast turnover rates. Physical fractionations of the intra- and inter-aggregate materials, and those associated with silt and clay, showed that all pools contain both old and young materials. Charcoal is old but not inert. The C:N ratio changes from 25 to 70:1 for plant residues to 6 to 9:1 for soil biota and microbial products associated with soil minerals. Active, slow and passive (resistant) pool concepts have been well used in biogeochemical models. The concepts discussed herein have implications for today's challenges in nutrient cycling, biogeochemistry, soil ecosystem functioning, pollution control, feeding the expanding global population and global change.},

  abstract = {Leaf nitrogen and leaf surface area influence the exchange of gases between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere, and play a significant role in the global cycles of carbon, nitrogen and water. The purpose of this study is to use field-based and satellite remote-sensing-based methods to assess leaf nitrogen pools in five diverse European agricultural landscapes located in Denmark, Scotland (United Kingdom), Poland, the Netherlands and Italy. REGFLEC (REGularized canopy reFLECtance) is an advanced image-based inverse canopy radiative transfer modelling system which has shown proficiency for regional mapping of leaf area index (LAI) and leaf chlorophyll (CHLl) using remote sensing data. In this study, high spatial resolution (10\textendash{}20 m) remote sensing images acquired from the multispectral sensors aboard the SPOT (Satellite For Observation of Earth) satellites were used to assess the capability of REGFLEC for mapping spatial variations in LAI, CHLland the relation to leaf nitrogen (Nl) data in five diverse European agricultural landscapes. REGFLEC is based on physical laws and includes an automatic model parameterization scheme which makes the tool independent of field data for model calibration. In this study, REGFLEC performance was evaluated using LAI measurements and non-destructive measurements (using a SPAD meter) of leaf-scale CHLl and Nl concentrations in 93 fields representing crop- and grasslands of the five landscapes. Furthermore, empirical relationships between field measurements (LAI, CHLl and Nl and five spectral vegetation indices (the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, the Simple Ratio, the Enhanced Vegetation Index-2, the Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, and the green chlorophyll index) were used to assess field data coherence and to serve as a comparison basis for assessing REGFLEC model performance. The field measurements showed strong vertical CHLl gradient profiles in 26\% of fields which affected REGFLEC performance as well as the relationships between spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) and field measurements. When the range of surface types increased, the REGFLEC results were in better agreement with field data than the empirical SVI regression models. Selecting only homogeneous canopies with uniform CHLl distributions as reference data for evaluation, REGFLEC was able to explain 69\% of LAI observations (rmse = 0.76), 46\% of measured canopy chlorophyll contents (rmse = 719 mg m-2) and 51\% of measured canopy nitrogen contents (rmse = 2.7 g m-2). Better results were obtained for individual landscapes, except for Italy, where REGFLEC performed poorly due to a lack of dense vegetation canopies at the time of satellite recording. Presence of vegetation is needed to parameterize the REGFLEC model. Combining REGFLEC- and SVI-based model results to minimize errors for a "snap-shot" assessment of total leaf nitrogen pools in the five landscapes, results varied from 0.6 to 4.0 t km-2. Differences in leaf nitrogen pools between landscapes are attributed to seasonal variations, extents of agricultural area, species variations, and spatial variations in nutrient availability. In order to facilitate a substantial assessment of variations in Nl pools and their relation to landscape based nitrogen and carbon cycling processes, time series of satellite data are needed. The upcoming Sentinel-2 satellite mission will provide new multiple narrowband data opportunities at high spatio-temporal resolution which are expected to further improve remote sensing capabilities for mapping LAI, CHLl and Nl.},

  abstract = {Accurately monitoring of tree phenological dynamics is crucial for understanding how forest ecosystems respond to various climate changes, and a variety of methods recently have been established for accomplishing this task. However, efficient techniques for featuring conifer phenology are still lacking. In fact, characterizing conifer phenological variations have long been an issue, because conifers tend to show hard-to-discern changes in terms of no matter color or crown morphology for different seasons. To address this conventional ``conifer issue'', this study attempted the state-of-the-art remote sensing technology of mobile terrestrial light detection and ranging (LiDAR) (also termed as mobile terrestrial laser scanning, MLS) to reflect the seasonal-scale phenological variations of conifers, specifically in a case of Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris) growing under the Mediterranean climate in Perth, Australia. The MLS-collected data shows that for the conifers growing under different temperature and precipitation conditions, lasers, in a statistical sense, behave with different penetrations into their crowns. In light of this phenomenon, a new seasonal-scale conifer phenological indicator (CsPI) was proposed, i.e. the ratio between the average of the horizontal penetration distances for the entire laser points backscattered from a crown and its diameter calculated along with the horizontal direction of laser incidence. The performance of the newly-proposed CsPI was assessed by the means of meta-analysis, i.e. comparing the CsPI-indicated conifer response to seasonal climate changes in Perth with the derived rule of stem radial growth rates at different seasons in Mesic, Spain, both in the Mediterranean climate scenarios. The correlations with positive results showed that the proposed schematic plan of applying MLS and the developed phenological indicator both are validated, and this study has opened a new way for reflecting the seasonal-scale phenological variations of conifers.},

For two tasks, phenotypes fall on the line connecting the two archetypes, which could explain linear trait correlations, allometric relationships, as well as bacterial gene-expression patterns. For three tasks, phenotypes fall within a triangle in phenotype space, whose vertices are the archetypes, as evident in morphological studies, including on Darwin's finches. Tasks can be inferred from measured phenotypes based on the behavior of organisms nearest the archetypes.
The fitness of an organism can be modeled graphically to determine how phenotypic trade-offs are maximized.

  abstract = {Recent increases in fire and insect disturbances have contributed to a transition of Canada's managed forest carbon balance from sink to source. Further increases in area burned could contribute positive feedback to climate change. We made probabilistic forecasts of the recovery of C sinks in Canada's managed forest between 2010 and 2100 under two assumptions about future area burned by wildfire: (1) no increase relative to levels observed in the last half of the 20th century and (2) linear increases by a factor of two or four (depending on region) from 2010 to 2100. Recovery of strong C sinks in Canada's managed forest will be delayed until at least the 2030s because of insect outbreaks, even if predicted increases in area annually burned do not occur. After 2050, our simulations project an annual probability of a sink near 70\% with no increase in area burned and 35\% with increasing area burned. All simulations project a cumulative C source from 2010\textendash{}2100, even if annual area burned does not increase. If the sink strength of terrestrial ecosystems is reduced because of increasing natural disturbances, then it will become more difficult to achieve global atmospheric CO 2  stabilization targets.

  abstract = {This digital data release consists of seven data files of soil attributes for the United States and the District of Columbia. The files are derived from National Resources Conservations Service's (NRCS) Soil Survey Geographic database (SSURGO). The data files can be linked to the raster datasets of soil mapping unit identifiers (MUKEY) available through the NRCS's Gridded Soil Survey Geographic (gSSURGO) database (http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/soils/survey/geo/?cid=nrcs142p2\_053628). The associated files, named DRAINAGECLASS, HYDRATING, HYDGRP, HYDRICCONDITION, LAYER, TEXT, and WTDEP are area- and depth-weighted average values for selected soil characteristics from the SSURGO database for the conterminous United States and the District of Columbia. The SSURGO tables were acquired from the NRCS on March 5, 2014. The soil characteristics in the DRAINAGE table are drainage class (DRNCLASS), which identifies the natural drainage conditions of the soil and refers to the frequency and duration of wet periods. The soil characteristics in the HYDRATING table are hydric rating (HYDRATE), a yes/no field that indicates whether or not a map unit component is classified as a "hydric soil". The soil characteristics in the HYDGRP table are the percentages for each hydrologic group per MUKEY. The soil characteristics in the HYDRICCONDITION table are hydric condition (HYDCON), which describes the natural condition of the soil component. The soil characteristics in the LAYER table are available water capacity (AVG\_AWC), bulk density (AVG\_BD), saturated hydraulic conductivity (AVG\_KSAT), vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity (AVG\_KV), soil erodibility factor (AVG\_KFACT), porosity (AVG\_POR), field capacity (AVG\_FC), the soil fraction passing a number 4 sieve (AVG\_NO4), the soil fraction passing a number 10 sieve (AVG\_NO10), the soil fraction passing a number 200 sieve (AVG\_NO200), and organic matter (AVG\_OM). The soil characteristics in the TEXT table are percent sand, silt, and clay (AVG\_SAND, AVG\_SILT, and AVG\_CLAY). The soil characteristics in the WTDEP table are the annual minimum water table depth (WTDEP\_MIN), available water storage in the 0-25 cm soil horizon (AWS025), the minimum water table depth for the months April, May and June (WTDEPAMJ), the available water storage in the first 25 centimeters of the soil horizon (AWS25), the dominant drainage class (DRCLSD), the wettest drainage class (DRCLSWET), and the hydric classification (HYDCLASS), which is an indication of the proportion of the map unit, expressed as a class, that is "hydric", based on the hydric classification of a given MUKEY. (See Entity\_Description for more detail). The tables were created with a set of arc macro language (aml) and awk (awk was created at Bell Labsin the 1970s and its name is derived from the first letters of the last names of its authors \textendash{} Alfred Aho, Peter Weinberger, and Brian Kernighan) scripts.

Among all fluorescence parameters, the photosynthetic electron transport rate (ETR) is a useful indicator of the efficiency of carbon uptake. Traditionally, Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) fluorometry was a key technique for measuring ETR, but it is not applicable for large-scale monitoring. Alternatively, hyperspectral remote sensing has a great potential for this purpose and as thus several indices generated from hyperspectral reflectance have been developed for tracing ETR. In this study, we have extensively examined the performance of twelve early published indices for tracing leaf ETR of a typical deciduous species (Fagus crenata) in a cold-temperate mountainous area. Furthermore, developing of new hyperspectral indices has also been conducted based on both original and first derivative reflected spectra. Results revealed that our proposed index (dmND680, 540, 835) was applicable for both sunlit and shaded leaves and had a high robustness, suggesting its potential for a general application.},

  abstract = {The mapping of ecosystem service supply has become quite common in ecosystem service assessment practice for terrestrial ecosystems, but land cover remains the most common indicator for ecosystems ability to deliver ecosystem services. For marine ecosystems, practice is even less advanced, with a clear deficit in spatially-explicit assessments of ecosystem service supply. This situation, which generates considerable uncertainty in the assessment of ecosystems' ability to support current and future human well-being, contrasts with increasing understanding of the role of terrestrial and marine biodiversity for ecosystem functioning and thereby for ecosystem services. This paper provides a synthesis of available approaches, models and tools, and data sources, that are able to better link ecosystem service mapping to current understanding of the role of ecosystem service providing organisms and land/seascape structure in ecosystem functioning. Based on a review of literature, models and associated geo-referenced metrics are classified according to the way in which land or marine use, ecological processes and especially biodiversity effects are represented. We distinguish five types of models: proxy-based, phenomenological, niche-based, trait-based and full-process. Examples from each model type are presented and data requirements considered. Our synthesis demonstrates that the current understanding of the role of biota in ecosystem services can effectively be incorporated into mapping approaches and opens avenues for further model development using hybrid approaches tailored to available resources. We end by discussing ways to resolve sources of uncertainty associated with model representation of biotic processes and with data availability.},

  abstract = {The electromagnetic radiation (EMR) signals collected by satellites in the solar spectrum are modified by scattering and absorption by gases and aerosols while traveling through the atmosphere from the Earth's surface to the sensor. When and how to correct the atmospheric effects depend on the remote sensing and atmospheric data available, the information desired, and the analytical methods used to extract the information. In many applications involving classification and change detection, atmospheric correction is unnecessary as long as the training data and the data to be classified are in the same relative scale. In other circumstances, corrections are mandatory to put multitemporal data on the same radiometric scale in order to monitor terrestrial surfaces over time. A multitemporal dataset consisting of seven Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images from 1988 to 1996 of the Pearl River Delta, Guangdong Province, China was used to compare seven absolute and one relative atmospheric correction algorithms with uncorrected raw data. Based on classification and change detection results, all corrections improved the data analysis. The best overall results are achieved using a new method which adds the effect of Rayleigh scattering to conventional dark object subtraction. Though this method may not lead to accurate surface reflectance, it best minimizes the difference in reflectances within a land cover class through time as measured with the Jeffries\textendash{}Matusita distance. Contrary to expectations, the more complicated algorithms do not necessarily lead to improved performance of classification and change detection. Simple dark object subtraction, with or without the Rayleigh atmosphere correction, or relative atmospheric correction are recommended for classification and change detection applications.},

Our analysis indicated that 29.4\% and 2.9\% of the land area of Canada and Alaska showed statistically significant positive (greening) and negative (browning) trends respectively, at significance level p \&lt; 0.01, after burned forest areas were masked out. The area with greening trend dominated over that with browning trend for all land cover types. The greening occurred primarily in the tundra of western Alaska, along the north coast of Canada and in northeastern Canada; the most intensive and extensive greening occurred in Quebec and Labrador. The browning occurred mostly in the boreal forests of eastern Alaska. The Landsat-based greenness trend is broadly similar to the 8-km GIMMS AVHRR-based trend for all vegetation zones. However, for tundra, the Landsat data indicated much less extensive greening in Alaska North Slope and much more extensive greening in Quebec and Labrador, and substantially less extensive browning trend in the boreal forests that were free of fire disturbances. These differences call for further validation of the Landsat reflectance and the AVHRR NDVI datasets. Correlation study with local environmental factors, such as topography, glacial history and soil condition, will be needed to understand the heterogeneous greenness change at the Landsat scale.},
