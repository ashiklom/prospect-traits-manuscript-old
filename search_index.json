Relationship of functional diversity to overall productivity is complex, with increased productivity with increasing biodiversity in many cases (refs in Hooper) but evidence suggesting such increases are limited to certain species combinations (Hooper and Dukes 2004; probably Hooper et al. 2005). Plant functional traits are a powerful framework for studying plant functional diversity (Violle et al. 2007). Identification of coordinated relationships of plant functional traits with environmental conditions is appealing for ecological inference and modelling because it greatly facilitates the representation of functional response to environmental change [van Bodegom, Douma, and Verheijen (2014); @]. (DGVM trait papers here) Traits can also be used to model community composition: Jamil et al. (2013) – species means, GLMM Shipley’s MaxEnt model (Shipley, Vile, and Garnier 2006; Laughlin et al. 2011) Laughlin’s hierarchical model (Laughlin et al. 2012) Community-weighted means, custom “CATS” model (Frenette-Dussault et al. 2013) PCA on traits to classify plants into Grime’s CSR functional types (Pierce et al. 2013) Multimodal version of the traitspace model (Laughlin et al. 2015) Leaf traits in particular are consistently among the most important traits for predicting community composition (Laughlin 2014). Plant functional traits modulate species responses to environmental gradients [Pollock, Morris, and Vesk (2012); others]. Understanding the structure and inherent dimensionality of the plant functional trait space is important to identifying the marginal information content of multiple trait observations, which is critical to maximizing the utility of costly trait collection efforts and for predicting species distributions (Laughlin 2014; Bernhardt-Römermann et al. 2008; ???; Weiher et al. 1999; Pérez-Harguindeguy et al. 2013). Better understanding of the drivers of trait variability will also be useful for imputation of missing data in trait databases (Taugourdeau et al. 2014). This imputation also provides an excellent mechanism for testing theories of functional variability, as the imputation is effectively a phylogenetic forecast. Lots to be gained from global studies of species and community-level means. Many important theories of species-level function related to traits, aided by the increased prevalence of global trait datasets (e.g. TRY, Kattge et al. 2011; betydb, LeBauer et al. 2017). Grime’s CSR functional types. Leaf and plant economic spectrum (Wright et al. 2004; Reich 2014; Díaz et al. 2016; Ordoñez et al. 2009) Westoby (1998) strategy has three axes, of which only one is related to the leaf economic spectrum (Laughlin et al. 2010). (More examples). Need to capture sub-species-level variability Understanding variability at the sub-species level is critical to predictive ecology, as this is the scale at which most relevant ecophysiological processes occur. Although the plant ecology tends to focus on interspecific variability, intraspecific variability is also important (Cécile Hélène Albert, Thuiller, Yoccoz, Soudant, et al. 2010; Cécile Hélène Albert, Thuiller, Yoccoz, Douzet, et al. 2010; Albert et al. 2011). To quote J. S. Clark, Bell, Hersh, Kwit, et al. (2011), “Species do not compete, individuals do. Species do not respond to climate, individuals respond to weather.” Community mean trait variability is driven both by composition and plasticity of individual species (Richardson et al. 2005). Clark (2016) argues that uncertainty in composition contributes more than uncertainty in traits to overall uncertainty in community-weighted means. Violle et al. (2012) – Return of the variance: intraspecific variability Messier, McGill, and Lechowicz (2010) – Multi-scale inference Messier et al. (2016) – Leaf economic spectrum at local scales Different ecological processes occur at different scales. For example, global studies of species- and community-level aggregates may capture broad-scale environmental filters, but trait variability at smaller scales becomes increasingly affected by limiting similarity [J. S. Clark, Bell, Hersh, Kwit, et al. (2011); Kraft, Valencia, and Ackerly (2008); refs therein; need a classic paper here]. Measuring enough traits for multi-scale inference is hard. Leaf spectral measurements are a promising solution. Understanding plant functional variability requires trait measurements at many different scales, and capturing acclimatory ecophysiological responses further requires repeat measurements of traits on the same individual and probably even the same organ. These goals are difficult to achieve using traditional approaches to trait measurement because they are very labor intensive, limiting sample sizes required for robust inference, and are almost always destructive, precluding repeat sampling for tracking developmental and acclimatory responses. By comparison, spectral measurements are considerably easier and faster to collect, and are non-destructive, allowing repeat sampling over the course of a season or experimental manipulation. Hyperspectral reflectance measurements in particular also have more information content than direct trait measurements, with a single observation capable of providing information about multiple traits (Roth et al. 2016). This means that spectra are uniquely equipped to avoid disaggregation of trait information (J. S. Clark, Bell, Hersh, Kwit, et al. 2011). Optical functional types (Ustin &amp; Gamon 2010) Spectral measurements have been successfully used to investigate: Leaf reflectance is related to plant stress (Carter 1993; Peñuelas et al. 1994; Peñuelas et al. 1993) Serbin et al. (2011) – Sensitivity to temperature (PLSR) Serbin et al. (2014) – Trait estimation (PLSR) Asner, Martin, Tupayachi, et al. (2014) – Investigate the drivers of functional diversity (very similar to what I’m trying to do, only limited to the Amazon, and using PLSR) Refer to review by Peñuelas and Filella (1998) Zajec et al. (2016) show effects of limestone dust deposition on leaf optical properties and traits. Moreover, spectral measurements also provide a link to remote sensing, which creates the potential for trait inference at the landscape and regional scale over long time scales (Asner, Knapp, et al. 2016). Understanding spectral and functional variability at the plot scale is also important to determining the potential of using satellite remote sensing, which is fundamentally limited by spatial resolution to at least the plot scale and above, to study traits. The vast increase in spatial scale and continuity afforded by remote measurement of plant traits will also be very helpful in overcoming current sampling biases in trait databases (e.g. Sandel et al. 2015). Most spectra-trait methods are empirical. Our RTM approach is better. (Should this go in methods?) The typical approaches to estimating traits from spectra are based on empirical calibrations of spectra with direct measurements of leaf traits, through the use of spectral indices (Sims and Gamon 2002; Féret et al. 2011; Colombo et al. 2008; Stimson et al. 2005; Peñuelas et al. 1993; Peñuelas et al. 1994; Maki, Ishiahra, and Tamura 2004; Datt 1998; Danson and Bowyer 2004), wavelet transforms (Cheng, Rivard, and Sánchez-Azofeifa 2011; Cheng et al. 2014; Blackburn and Ferwerda 2008; Rivard et al. 2008; Bruce and Li 2001), clustering algorithms (e.g. random forest, Clark and Roberts 2012), or partial least squares regression (Serbin et al. 2011; Serbin et al. 2014; Asner, Martin, Tupayachi, et al. 2014; Asner, Martin, Carranza-Jiménez, et al. 2014; Chavana-Bryant et al. 2016). In this study, however, we estimate traits from spectra using Bayesian inversion of the PROSPECT 5 model (Jacquemoud and Baret 1990; Feret et al. 2008) described in Shiklomanov et al. (2016). This approach has three important advantages. First, because it is underpinned by a mechanistic model, it is likely to be more general than empirical approaches relying on site-specific calibrations. An early critique of empirical approaches is Grossman et al. (1996), who showed that, for example, absorption coefficients selected by multiple regression are primarily a statistical artifact. Second, the Bayesian aspect allows for the estimation of uncertainty in leaf traits due to errors in the observation or model. Notably, Bayesian radiative transfer model inversion is compatible with data in a wide variety of formats, spectral resolutions, and transformations because the modeled spectra can always be transformed to match the observations (e.g., spectral resolution in Shiklomanov et al. 2016). This flexibility is particularly important to studies like this one, where data are taken from multiple projects and instruments. Third, the use of radiative transfer models is important to understanding the underlying physical mechanisms underlying variability in foliar optical properties. In particular, complex multivariate regression analyses such as PLSR select wavelengths based entirely on model accuracy rather than physical meaning of the underlying coefficients (though diligent studies check that these variable selection techniques align with known absorption features; e.g. Serbin et al. (2014)). 1.2 Old Notes However, plant economic relationships often do not hold at smaller scales. For example, in an analysis of global foliar plant traits from the TRY database, Shiklomanov et al. (????) (in review) found that trait variability is fundamentally hierarchical, with leaf economic relationships primarily observed between means of plant functional types while the same correlations within plant functional types were significantly weaker or even of opposite sign. Many studies of plant traits at the scale of individual sites also found weak or no evidence of leaf economic relationships (REF). The same is true of studies of trait variability across environmental gradients. For instance, although globally, TRAIT X DECLINES/INCREASES with temperature, local-scale studies along elevation gradients observed the opposite (REF). Similarly, although enhanced nutrient availability should promote increased TRAIT X, greenhouse studies precisely controlling soil nutrient levels observed TRAIT X INCREASES/DECLINES with increased N availability (REF). The same traits have been found to be primarily influenced by different environmental filters in different studies. For instance, many studies in grasslands (e.g. Kleyer et al. 2012 and refs therein; Louault et al. 2005) found that C:N ratio and canopy height are strongly modulated by grazing intensity more than soil nutrient content (though they say the phosphorus thing is due to “site peculiarities”, namely defecating animals), but Westoby et al. (1996) and Grime et al. (1997) (What biomes??) found the opposite, whereby leaf C:N ratio and height were more closely linked to soil nutrients than disturbance intensity. In addition, leaf economic traits do not capture all aspects of plant function; for instance, they are decoupled from plant hydraulic traits (Li et al. 2015; Sack et al. 2003). This study is driven by the following research questions: How accurate is Bayesian PROSPECT inversion for estimating leaf traits from spectra across a variety of ecosystems? How are leaf optical traits related to other leaf foliar traits? What are the biotic and abiotic drivers of variability in leaf optical traits? 1.3 Further reading Trait theory papers: Grime (1977) – Prominent ecological theory of trait variability: competitors, stress-tolerators, ruderals (CSR) Westoby (1998) – Leaf height seed (LHS) plant strategy idea, similar to Grime’s CSR J.

Leaf mesophyll number is important because… Chlorophyll concentrations control light absorption and photosynthetic potential (Richardson et al. 2002), and, as the most nitrogen-rich component of leaves, provide a useful indication of leaf nitrogen (and general nutrition) status (Moran et al. 2000). Carotenoid pigments in this context encompass many different pigments related to the xanthophyll cycle. They are related to photochemical stress (Magney et al. 2014) (** See references in Magney) and other stuff. Brown matter concentrations are ???**. Leaf water content is related to drought stress (Carter 1993; Asner, Brodrick, et al. 2016; Peñuelas et al. 1993; Peñuelas et al. 1994) (Refs in Asner 2016), nutrient stress (REFS), and insect damage (Cheng et al. 2010) and is a key variable for assessing susceptibility of ecosystems to fire (Agee et al. 2002). Leaf dry matter content: Correlated with specific leaf area and leaf nitrogen (Laughlin et al. 2010; Pierce et al. 2013), and therefore an important indicator of plant position on the leaf economic spectrum [Wright et al. (2004); others]. In addition to exploring these optical traits, we also examine their relationship with to leaf nitrogen per unit mass, related to carboxylation efficiency and which are an important indicator of nutrient stress (Field &amp; Mooney 1986), and leaf mass per area (LMA), an indicator of plant strategy with regard to carbon allocation and light availability (Ackerly 2004; Poorter et al. 2009). 2.2.2 Inversion algorithm Bayesian inversion of PROSPECT (Shiklomanov et al. 2016). Added effective sample size normalization, which down-weights the likelihood and therefore provides more conservative uncertainty estimates. 2.3 Statistical analysis Ideas: Calculate some ‘T-statistics’, as in Violle et al. (2012) ? Try the “fourth corner method” as in Dray and Legendre (2008) Build a matrix of species abundance at different sites, a matrix of trait values of species, and a matrix describing the environmental conditions at each site It seems like this falls into the Jim Clark aggregation trap of discarding individual variability. Could itself be an interesting finding? Probably too much for one paper. "],

In general, none of the distributions of the means look extreme, and for the most part, they all have the same general shape. Figure 3.2: Comparison of spectral trait estimates with direct measurements. Figure 3.2: Comparison of spectral trait estimates with direct measurements. There is an additive conifer bias. Beyond that, there seem to be issues with the Yang phenology and Wu Brazil datasets. In all cases, the measured values had a higher variance than estimates from spectral inversion. The largest difference in variance between measured values and spectral estimates was for carotenoid and dry matter contents, while variance was closest for chlorophyll content. It should be noted that this comparison only applies to spectral values which have associated trait measurements – i.e. the actual variance for all traits estimated from spectra may be considerably different. In all cases, covariance between traits is comparable or stronger in the measured values than in the spectral inversion estimates. Note that these results may not be completely reliable because the spectral estimates have no missing values (though they are filtered to the samples that have at least one trait measurement) whereas the trait data do. 3.2 Sources of trait variability NOTE: All of the results in this section assume that the values above are accurate. They may change if I revise the model used to estimate spectra. 3.2.1 Correlations among PROSPECT traits The within- and across-species relationships between parameters are different. Across species, there are two orthagonal axes of variability, with the primary axis driven by pigment concentrations and the secondary axis driven by leaf structure (as manifested by contents of brown and dry matter contents, water thickness, and number of mesophyll layers). Within species, the primary axis of variability is ??? 3.2.2 Drivers of variability in PROSPECT traits Related to the results above, the primary drivers of variability in PROSPECT traits are trait-dependent. The number of leaf mesophyll layers, brown matter content, and water thickness are dominated largely by among-species variability. Much of the among-species variability in the N parameter is explained by leaf type (broad vs. needle), with some additional contribution of shade tolerance. Leaf type is also important in explaining variability in leaf water content, as is plant growth form. However, large fractions of this variability are unexplained by any functional attribute, contributing to high residual species-level variability. Most of the variability in the remaining traits – pigment and dry matter contents – is within species, and the majority of that variability remains unexplained. For all traits, site is an important factor, accounting for approximately 25% of the variance on average. Woody species (trees and shrubs) had higher N and lower Cm values than herbaceous species (grasses (zero) and herbs). Needleleaf species had higher N and lower pigment, brown, and dry matter contents than broadleaf species. Compared to species with arbuscular (AM, (zero)) mycorrhizal associations, species with ectomycorrhizal associations (EM/ECM) had significantly lower N and higher pigment, brown, and dry matter contents, while the reverse was true of species with erocoid (ERM) mycorrhizal associations. Evergreen species had higher pigment, brown matter, and dry matter contents and lower N than deciduous species. Strongly shade tolerant species had significantly higher N and lower pigment, brown matter, and dry matter contents than species with lower shade tolerance. Relationships between plant traits and climate occur primarily at the species level, with relatively flat relationships between climate and species mean residuals. Leaf water thickness and carotenoid, brown matter, and dry matter contents all have a negative relationship with precipitation, while the N parameter and chlorophyll contents have a positive relationship. All traits have weak positive relationships with temperature, except brown matter content, for which this relationship is strongly negative. "],
["discussion.html", "4 Discussion 4.1 Methods 4.2 Ecology 4.3 Other notes", " 4 Discussion 4.1 Methods Colombo et al. (2008) also performed PROSPECT inversion to estimate leaf water and dry matter contents. They were able to estimate EWT with no prior information, but that simultaneous estimation of EWT and LDMC was more challenging. Leaf water content tends to confound the extraction of other leaf constituents, particularly dry matter content (Kokaly and Clark 1999). This may help explain the large uncertainties in our estimates of dry matter content. The relationship between leaf dry matter content (for which we had no direct measurements in this study) and leaf mass per area is unclear. Some studies have assumed that the two traits are comparable (e.g. Cheng et al. 2014), but other studies that have explored the correlations explicitly found that is not necessarily the case (REFS). 4.2 Ecology Genetic basis behind leaf economic spectrum (Donovan et al. 2011). LMA trends in evergreen leaves; e.g. shade tolerance (Lusk et al. 2008). Importance of intraspecific variability in ecology, and how to study it (Violle et al. 2012). Asner, Martin, Tupayachi, et al. (2014) – Very similar to this study. Lots of points of comparison. Look for ways to replicate analyses. Asner, Martin, Carranza-Jiménez, et al. (2014) – Also very similar. Look at his GLM approach. In ponderosa pine-Gambel oak, mixed conifer, and subalpine forests (US Southwest, Arizona, near Grand Canyon), specific leaf area increased in mean (decreased LMA) and variance (increased for LMA too) (Laughlin et al. 2012). Laughlin et al. (2012) also observed high variance in traits – as much as 60% – for a given MAT. In grazed, semi-natural grasslands in Europe, plant life history (which traits?) associated with availabile phosphorus, while grazing intensity is related to C:N ratio. Specifically, SLA increased (LMA decreased) with disturbance intensity, while onset of flowering and C:N ratio decreased. Phosphorus was positively related to SLA (negatively to LMA) and onset of flowering, and negatively related to C:N ratio, seed mass, and polycarpic life history (?) (Kleyer et al. 2012). Laughlin et al. (2010) has evidence of leaf economic relationships in ponderosa pine forest in northern Arizona; high SLA (low LMA) species also have high leaf and fine root N and low leaf dry matter content. Among Australian eucalypt taxa, low SLA (high LMA) improves the response of short species to rainfall and sunlight; tall species increased with rainfall and sunlight over all SLA values, but low SLA (high LMA) species were particularly sensitive to rainfall (Pollock, Morris, and Vesk 2012). Pierce et al. (2013) treat find that LDMC is strongly negatively correlated with SLA (positively with LMA) and, more weakly, with leaf N, and strongly positively correlated with leaf C. Roth et al. (2016) – Three different principal components of spectral variability. PC1 correlates best with leaf structure and surface scattering. PC2 correlates best with lignin, water, and LMA. PC3 correlates with surface scattering and pigments. Coexistence depends on competition being stronger within than between species (Clark 2010) (More theory on this). The future is remote sensing of functional traits. Remote sensing provides an approach to overcoming the inherent issues with space for time substitution by measuring ecosystem responses to climate change directly through time (J. S. Clark, Bell, Hersh, and Nichols 2011). 4.3 Other notes Although the N parameter is supposed to represent the effective number of leaf mesophyll layers (or 1 more than the number of leaf intracellular air spaces), its global modulation of reflectance may mean it is also influenced by spectrally invariant specular reflectance off the leaf surface. The composition of the leaf surface, such as cutin and wax, may also be related to the leaf dry matter content absorption coefficient (da Luz 2006). Early efforts to extent the PROSPECT model to additional compounds like lignin, cellulose, and protein (e.g. Jacquemoud et al. 1996; Fourty et al. 1996) have been largely abandoned by the community in favor of empirical approaches like PLSR, wavelets, etc. However, we suggest that such efforts be revisited. Moving from the leaf to the canopy scale is challenging. Wavelengths of most importance for estimating traits (e.g. pigments, Yoder and Pettigrew-Crosby (1995)) may be different at the leaf and canopy scales due to confounding influences of structural variables. This is why it is important to use and enhance radiative transfer models. However, remote retrievals using inversion of coupled leaf and canopy radiative transfer models are promising (Jacquemoud 1993; Jacquemoud et al. 1995). "],
